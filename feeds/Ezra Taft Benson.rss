Sadness comes to all of us in the loss of loved ones. But there is gratitude also. Gratitude for the assurance we have that life is eternal. Gratitude for the great gospel plan, given freely to all of us. Gratitude for the life, teachings, and sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ, whose resurrection we will commemorate in the immediate days ahead.</p>

Sometimes the veil between this life and the life beyond becomes very thin. Our loved ones who have passed on are not far from us. One great spiritual leader asked, “But where is the spirit world?” and then answered his own question. “It is here.” “Do [spirits] go beyond the boundaries of this organized earth? No, they do not. They are brought forth upon this earth, for the express purpose of inhabiting it to all eternity.” “… when the spirits leave their bodies they are in the presence of our Father and God; they are prepared then to see, hear and understand spiritual things. … If the Lord would permit it, and it was His will that it should be done, you could see the spirits that have departed from this world, as plainly as you now see bodies with your natural eyes. …” (Brigham Young, in <span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses, </span>vol. 3, pp. 367–69.)</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/life-is-eternal.p26" guid="2d5a6c0d-5809-47e5-b460-cbda61c0e672" pid="EQuzhLJscE6rnOIGxbUGHQ" hash="scPAHg">In a certain home, a little boy, the only son, was ill with an incurable disease. Month after month the mother had tenderly nursed him, but as the weeks went by and he grew no better, the little fellow gradually began to understand the meaning of death and he, too, realized that soon he was to die. One day his mother had been reading the story of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, and as she closed the book the boy lay silent for a moment, then asked the question that had been laying on his heart. “Mother, what is it like to die? Mother, does it hurt?” Quick tears filled her eyes. She sprang to her feet and fled to the kitchen, supposedly to go get something. She prayed on the way a silent prayer that the Lord would tell her what to say, and the Lord did tell her. Immediately she knew how to explain it to him. She said as she returned from the kitchen, “Kenneth, you will remember when you were a little boy, you would play so hard you were too tired to undress and you tumbled into your mother’s bed and fell asleep. In the morning you would wake up and much to your surprise, you would find yourself in your own bed. In the night your father would pick you up in his big strong arms and carry you to your own bedroom. Kenneth, death is like that; we just wake up one morning to find ourselves in the room where we belong because the Lord Jesus loves us.” The lad’s shining face looked up and told her there would be no more fear, only love and trust in his heart as he went to meet the Father in heaven. He never questioned again and several weeks later he feel asleep, just as she said. That is what death is like. (See Catherine Marshall, <span class="emphasis">A Man Called Peter </span>(New York: McGraw Hill, 1951), pp. 272–73.)</p>

We cannot conceive of our lives without his teachings. Without him we would be lost in a mirage of beliefs and worships, born in fear and darkness where the sensual and materialistic hold sway.

Observe that the man of God is a happy man. The hedonist, who proclaims “Do your thing,” who lives for sinful, so-called pleasure, is never happy. Behind his mask of mock gaiety lurks the inevitable tragedy of eternal death. Haunted by its black shadow, he trades the useful, happy life for the bleak forgetfulness of drugs, alcohol, sex, and rock.</p>

In his cunning he knows where and how to strike. It is in youth when his victims are most vulnerable. Youth is the springtime of life when all things are new. Youth is the spirit of adventure and awakening. It is a time of physical emerging when the body can attain the vigor and good health that may scorn the caution of temperance. Youth is a time of timelessness when the horizons of age often seem too distant to be noticed. Thus, the “now” generation forgets that the present will soon be the past that looks to a life left in waste or a past rich in works. These are the ingredients in youth that make Satan’s plan of “play now and pay later” so irresistible. Yes, the devil uses many tools.</p>

To confuse youth in its searching years, the cynic defends his degeneracy by ridiculing his critics with confusing metaphors. The words of the rock recording ‘I Couldn’t Get High,’ then ‘High on the Mountain Top’ must be stricken from our songbooks. Scoffing in this manner may bring an easy laugh and a reassurance that all is well in Zion, but it is diabolically dishonest.</p>

The relativist will say, ‘If one sees filthy implications in a popular song, it is because he has a dirty mind.’ The logic of this philosophy finds its fallacy in the word implications. No filth is implied in many of the lyrics. It is proclaimed.</p>

The well-publicized perversions of its practitioners alone are enough to condemn its influence. Its ultimate achievement is that contemporary phenomenon, the mammoth rock music festival. As these diseased celebrations mount into the hundreds, they infect youth by the hundreds of thousands. And where is there today a rock festival that is not also a drug festival, a sex festival, and a rebellion festival?” (Richard Nibley.)</p>

Would his Spirit bless with its presence these festering festivals of human degradation cured in LSD, marijuana, and Speed? Would he be pleased by the vulgar display of unashamed nudity and immorality? The speech of the rock festival is often obscene. Its music, crushing the sensibilities in a din of primitive idolatry, is in glorification of the physical to the debasement of the spirit. In the long panorama of man’s history, these youthful rock music festivals are among Satan’s greatest successes. The legendary orgies of Greece and Rome cannot compare to the monumental obscenities found in these cesspools of drugs, immorality, rebellion, and pornophonic sound. The famed Woodstock festival was a gigantic manifestation of a sick nation. Yet the lurid movie and rock recordings of its unprecedented filth were big business in our own mountain home.</p>

It was pleasing unto Satan when in First Nephi, Lehi’s children and the “sons of Ishmael and also their wives began to make themselves merry, insomuch that they began to dance, and to sing, and to speak with much rudeness. …” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/18.9" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 18:9</a>.)</p>

Religious rock is climbing up the ‘Top Ten’ charts. The growing resistance to the rock-drug scene is being diverted by this wholesome-appearing retreat from the new morality. But a review of religious rock materials unmasks an insidiously disguised anti-Christ. By reducing revealed religion to mythology, rock assumes the mantle of righteousness while rejecting the reality of sin. Without sin the new morality can continue in its Godless revel behind the pretense of religious robes. By reversing the roles of Jesus and Judas, one fast-selling album fits perfectly the warning of Isaiah [<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/5.20" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 5:20</a>]: ‘Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness.’” (Richard Nibley.)</p>

If it is small, undiversified, and unused, the complaint must rest on the parent. Seeds of culture are best sown in the fertile ground of infant imitation.

From reports in books, magazines, and newspapers—especially the youth sections—we learn that they are lewd, obscene, immoral, avaricious, and in some cases even cruel. It is the very life-style we are here to avoid that is paraded before our young people by their celebrated peers. To deflect the admiration of youth from these examples of the ugly life, we must start young. The care and feeding of children must include equal concern for their emotional lives as well as their physical, spiritual, and intellectual lives.</p>

But this burden must be shared by the parents. The family home evening is an important barrier to the works of Satan. The MIA program must protect our youth against every evil influence and should fill a vacuum left by rejecting worldly enticements. And, of course, a great panacea for all problems and personal doubts: prayer—private and family prayer, night and morning.</p>

Lee to what I believe is the highest office in the world, the earthly President of the church of Jesus Christ. I have known this great man longer possibly than any other one of the General Authorities. I honor him; I have admired him since we were boys together over fifty years ago. With all my heart I love and sustain him as a prophet of God, as an inspired leader, ideally qualified to lead the church of Christ in our difficult day. May God inspire us as members of the Church with wisdom to follow his noble leadership.</p>

And Saul responded with these momentous words: “… Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? …” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/9.6" class="scriptureRef">Acts 9:6</a>.) To this the Lord responded by sending Saul to see one of his authorized servants to receive direction and a blessing.</p>

What would the Lord Jesus Christ have us do? He has answered that question by saying, “Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.48" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 5:48</a>), and, “Therefore, what manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.27" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 27:27</a>).</p>

While many men have admirable qualities, there is only one man who ever walked the earth who was without sin, whose father of his physical body was God the Father, and who had the power to resurrect his own body. This Jesus is our exemplar and has commanded us to follow in his steps.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/listen-to-a-prophets-voice.p6" guid="95448913-1fd7-43de-9b68-15fdfd4fa9f3" pid="zUOX88X3lEaaXzYxt3tAFw" hash="toQRVQ">God the Father has given Jesus Christ a name above all others, so that eventually every knee will bow and every tongue confess that Jesus is the Christ. He is the way, the truth, and the light, and no one can come back into the presence of our Father in heaven except through him. Christ is God the Son and possesses every virtue in its perfection. Therefore, the only measure of true greatness is how close a man can become like Jesus. That man is greatest who is most like Christ, and those who love him most will be most like him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/listen-to-a-prophets-voice.p7" guid="21500247-9687-4f6c-a134-50c041876f64" pid="fSO6mNSCL0CU_H0j6L3ZtQ" hash="OxPqow">How, then, does a man imitate God, follow his steps, and walk as he walked, which we are commanded to do? We must study the life of Christ, learn his commandments, and do them. God has promised that to follow this course will lead a man to an abundant life and a fullness of joy and the peace and rest which those who are heavy-burdened long for. To learn of Christ necessitates the study of the scriptures and the testimonies of those who know him. We come to know him through prayer and the inspiration and revelation that God has promised to those who keep his commandments.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/listen-to-a-prophets-voice.p8" guid="d7953e89-0666-41b2-aae9-1588c5d465b0" pid="UpOkpR9QqE6n8Vhu3qnqgg" hash="1Rl6Bg">And how do you learn the commandments? You learn the commandments through the words of the Lord in the scriptures, through the revelations received by his authorized servants, the Light of Christ, like a conscience that comes to every man, and through personal revelation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/listen-to-a-prophets-voice.p9" guid="bbe778a2-f3f0-44cc-9c5f-0664813214fa" pid="ticCQIE6M06TJkbbeEtWGA" hash="EickxA">It is significant that when Paul asked the question, “Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?” Christ directed Paul to one of the Lord’s authorized servants. So it was with Cornelius, who after prayer was instructed to send men to contact Peter. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/10.title" class="scriptureRef">Acts 10</a>.) It has always been so—that whenever God has had his prophets upon the earth, men could go to them to learn of Christ and his commandments.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/listen-to-a-prophets-voice.p10" guid="1e8c63ca-6cab-4fdd-9375-79ee0380719c" pid="I4r_nIT9fkSjQmyF0uSEgg" hash="OHYyBg">The inspired words of these prophets, when written down, became scripture, and whenever God has his representatives on the earth, there is always new revelation and new scripture. Only when men became so corrupt that the prophets were taken out of their midst did scriptures cease. And God stated that only through his authorized representatives could men receive the ordinances essential for salvation and the commandments necessary for the perfecting of his children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/listen-to-a-prophets-voice.p11" guid="e959b827-f5d7-4f0e-ba35-727abbbf1529" pid="h23BJYorPkurHyZMfBBXxA" hash="rmRLpA">Speaking to his prophets, the Lord said: “He that receiveth you receiveth me. …” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/10.40" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 10:40</a>.) Always the words of the living prophet took precedence, for it was God’s message to the people at that particular time. Had any man accepted the ancient scripture in the days of Noah but refused to follow the revelation that Noah received and failed to board the ark, he would have been drowned. Always the words of the living prophets are of the most vital concern to the people; and always, if a man would know of Christ and learn his commandments so that he can obey them, he must seek to find his authorized representatives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/listen-to-a-prophets-voice.p12" guid="0adf5767-b565-4d35-8461-6ed38c253968" pid="Umfq-0wAtkexElxCHNX6YQ" hash="peZE2w">For centuries, because of the wickedness of men, prophets of God no longer walked the earth, so scripture ended with the last words in the New Testament. Confusion and contention reigned in so-called Christendom, for all they had was the ancient scripture, but they were without the prophets of God to explain it to them and to receive new revelation, new scripture, and to be authorized to direct the work of the ministry.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/listen-to-a-prophets-voice.p13" guid="264eda89-766c-4ace-ad9a-9a527dc63a1a" pid="mQ5oPfjbpkCxh1X-zcW7ag" hash="sWcfXQ">But in 1820, the greatest single event since the resurrection of the Christ occurred. God the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, personally visited a young boy by the name of Joseph Smith, who had been praying to know which church to join. God, our Father, spoke to the lad and said, “… <span class="emphasis">This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!</span>” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.17" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:17</a>.) God the Son told Joseph Smith not to join any of the churches. Joseph was to learn that the Lord’s true church was not on the earth; that living prophets of God, who were the foundation of the church, had not walked the earth for centuries; and that with their deaths, the rock of revelation on which the church was built ceased; and so there was no new scripture.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/listen-to-a-prophets-voice.p14" guid="479992b4-ee8d-4428-a260-3f4e057ae800" pid="_ZIpRG41bkO08ObHXc6jvg" hash="X_gQFQ">Eventually, to Joseph Smith appeared the men who were the last authorized servants to direct the church of Jesus Christ—Peter, James, and John. These glorified beings ordained Joseph Smith with the same authority they had received from Jesus, so that once again there was a prophet of God on the earth who could say, “… thus saith the Lord.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/44.1" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 44:1</a>.) Joseph Smith ordained others with the authority that he had received, and so the church of Jesus Christ was restored in these latter days—The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, commonly known as the Mormon Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/listen-to-a-prophets-voice.p15" guid="0b6159c4-3565-49ff-a002-5bd64bb8c5f0" pid="pkab8pKxs0G-VguiD8IjhA" hash="GaOabg">In due time, another heavenly messenger came to Joseph Smith to tell him that God was about to give to the earth a scriptural account of the early inhabitants of America, as the Bible is a scriptural account that covers the other side of the world. This American scripture that was translated by Joseph Smith, through the inspiration of heaven, is called the Book of Mormon. It tells, among other things, of Christ’s personal appearance to God’s children here in America after his resurrection in Jerusalem and of his instructions to them. The mission of the Book of Mormon is to be a companion volume with the Bible, to serve as a second witness that Jesus is the Christ, to show that God loves one nation as another, and to reduce contention by making clear many of the doctrines that have confused Christendom.</p>

The Lord’s mouthpiece and his prophet on the face of the earth today is President Harold B. Lee, who received his authority through a line of prophets going back to Joseph Smith, who was ordained by Peter, James, and John, who were ordained by Christ, who was and is the head of the Church, the Creator of this earth, and the God before whom all men must stand accountable.</p>

When Nathanael questioned Philip, telling him that he had found Jesus, Philip responded by saying, “Come and see.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/1.46" class="scriptureRef">John 1:46</a>.)</p>

If you sincerely desire to know of the truthfulness of this message, then make it a matter of fervent prayer, study it out, test it out, and God will let you know.</p>

Then put it to the test. Read the Book of Mormon, and near its close you will find a promise that is given to everyone who reads that volume; and this is the promise: that if you will ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, if this book is true, and if you will ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, then our Heavenly Father will manifest the truth of it unto you by the power of the Holy Ghost. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.4" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 10:4</a>.)</p>

I testify to you that I have read the Book of Mormon and that I have put it to the test; that God has revealed unto me the truthfulness of this added volume of scripture and revealed unto me that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God; and that Harold B. Lee is his prophet and representative and stands today as the earthly President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the one man on the earth who holds the keys of God’s kingdom, as Peter did anciently.</p>

Did the people in Noah’s day need a prophet to warn them spiritually and temporally? Had a man refused to follow Noah, would he have been saved from the flood? Yet the Bible tells us that in the last days in which we live, the wickedness of the people will become comparable to the wickedness of the people in Noah’s day when God cleansed the earth by flood. Do you think we need a prophet today to warn us and prepare us for the cleansing that God promised will come, this time by fire?</p>

Today that church is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and his prophet and mouthpiece is President Harold B. Lee. I know this as I know that I live, and I bear this testimony humbly and gratefully in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

As in the great Council in the heavens, so in the Church of Christ on earth, there can be no neutrality. We are, or we are not, on the side of the Lord.

A group of well-known historians has summarized those conditions leading to the downfall of Rome in these words:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/watchman-warn-the-wicked.p37" guid="5debc852-7028-4351-a514-8271053a1a28" pid="tVPG4pXjZkqgKOkkwbHnKg" hash="DNSpBQ">“… Rome had known a pioneer beginning not unlike our own pioneer heritage, and then entered into two centuries of greatness, reaching its pinnacle in the second of those centuries, going into the decline and collapse in the third. Yet, the sins of decay were becoming apparent in the latter years of that second century.</p>

The latter (the idle poor) were put on a permanent dole, a welfare system not unlike our own. As this system became permanent, the recipients of public largesse (welfare) increased in number. They organized into a political block with sizable power. They were not hesitant about making their demands known. Nor was the government hesitant about agreeing to their demands … and with ever-increasing frequency. Would-be emperors catered to them. The great, solid middle class—Rome’s strength then as ours is today—was taxed more and more to support a bureaucracy that kept growing larger, and even more powerful. Surtaxes were imposed upon incomes to meet emergencies. The government engaged in deficit spending. The denarius, a silver coin similar to our half dollar, began to lose its silvery hue. It took on a copper color as the government reduced the silver content.</p>

Indeed, a foreigner could win Roman citizenship simply by volunteering for service in the legions of Rome. But, with increasing affluence and opulence, the young men of Rome began avoiding this service, finding excuses to remain in the soft and sordid life of the city. They took to using cosmetics and wearing feminine-like hairdo’s and garments, until it became difficult, the historians tell us, to tell the sexes apart.</p>

It was inaugurated by the First Presidency at a general conference of the Church held in October, 1936, thirty-seven years ago. It is significant that the man who served for a quarter century as the first managing director of the General Church Welfare Committee is today the Lord’s mouthpiece on earth, President Harold B. Lee, and that President Marion G. Romney, who was so closely associated with him in that endeavor, now stands as a <span class="emphasis">counselor </span>at his side.</p>

Lee has wisely counseled that “perhaps if we think not in terms of a year’s supply of what we ordinarily would use, and think more in terms of what it would take to keep us alive in case we didn’t have anything else to eat, that last would be very easy to put in storage for a year … just enough to keep us alive if we didn’t have anything else to eat. We wouldn’t get fat on it, but we would live; and if you think in terms of that kind of annual storage rather than a whole year’s supply of everything that you are accustomed to eat which, in most cases, is utterly impossible for the average family, I think we will come nearer to what President Clark advised us way back in 1937.” (Welfare conference address, October 1, 1966.)</p>

Recent history has demonstrated that in difficult days it is reserves with intrinsic value that are of most worth, rather than reserves, the value of which may be destroyed through inflation. It is well to remember that continued government deficits cause inflation; inflation is used as an excuse for ineffective price controls; price controls lead to shortages; artificial shortages inevitably are used as an excuse to implement rationing.</p>

I have looked into the sunken eyes of Saints, in almost the last stages of starvation. I have seen faithful mothers carrying their children, three and four years of age, who were unable to walk because of malnutrition. I have seen a hungry woman turn down food for a spool of thread.

I have received the sweet assurance also and the comforting assurance that there is no untimely passing of a prophet of God. President Lee’s impressive earthly service is finished. He has been called to further important work in the great program of the Lord, which moves forward on both sides of the veil. He was a man with deep spiritual insight, with Christlike attributes.</p>

It is a dramatic chapter in the history of a “peculiar people.” But in all the annals of Christendom there is no greater evidence of courage, willingness to sacrifice, and unbounded devotion to duty. Men, women, and children all have joined in this heroic effort with no hope of material reward.</p>

Voluntarily fathers and sons have left homes, families, and jobs to go to all parts of the world, enduring great physical hardship and unrelenting persecution. Families have been left behind, often in dire straits, willingly laboring the harder to provide means for “their missionary.” And through it all there has been a joy and satisfaction which has caused families at home to express gratitude for special blessings received and missionaries to refer to this period as “the happiest time of my life.”</p>

These faithful emissaries, who have gone abroad, have expended from 98 to 105 million days of missionary effort at a cost, through loss of personal income and expense for living, of more than $420 to $450 million, and this does not include any costs of transportation to and from, or in the field, costs of administration at home or abroad, or expense of local missionary service.</p>

Yes, without doubt, it is the personal testimony of the divinity of this great latter-day work, faith in the commands of the Almighty, and our responsibility as his covenant children, the knowledge that God lives and loves his children, and the conviction that it is our mission to build and save men everywhere.</p>

Father Adam taught these things to his own children. (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.12" class="scriptureRef">Moses 5:12</a>.) Consider Noah’s long years of missionary effort and the preachings of all the ancient prophets. (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/8.16-20" class="scriptureRef">Moses 8:16–20</a>.) Each in his day was commanded to carry the gospel message to the children of men and call them to repentance as the only means of escaping the pending judgments.

Even greater promises were embodied in the revelations which followed, many of which referred in no uncertain terms to the solemn responsibility resting upon the restored church to preach the word. In the fall of that same year came the word of the Lord through the Prophet as follows:</p>

They were promised that their words would be prompted by the power of the Holy Ghost and would be the will of the Lord and scripture unto the people, inasmuch as they were faithful. They were told in no uncertain terms that they were being sent “out to prove the world,” that they should “not be weary in mind, neither darkened,” and a hair of their head should “not fall to the ground unnoticed.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.79-80" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:79–80</a>.)</p>

Add to this the fact that the heavenly pronouncements emphasized that this was the last time the gospel should be given to men as a witness in preparation for Christ’s second coming and the end of the world—the end of wickedness. Theirs was the responsibility of warning the world of impending judgments, as it is ours today. They knew, as do we, that the Lord has said:</p>

By this time many revelations had been received and the Church had shown considerable growth in spite of persecution and drivings from the powers of evil. At the conference of elders the Lord revealed through the Prophet Joseph a great revelation addressed to the people of his church and “unto all men, and there is none to escape. …” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.2" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:2</a>.) No message heretofore given set forth in such clarity and power the worldwide nature of the message of the restored gospel. If there had been any question before, this left no room for doubt. Our message is a world message.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/missionary-work-a-major-responsibility.p30" pid="ftyHbjXtg0uoKDotLtkkOQ" hash="R9YsYA">No person can read Section One of the Doctrine and Covenants, realizing that the Church accepts it as the word of the Lord, and ask why we send missionaries into all parts of the world. The responsibility, and a major one it is, falls squarely upon the membership of the Church, for “the voice of warning,” says the Lord, “shall be unto <span class="emphasis">all people,</span> by the mouths of <span class="emphasis">my</span> disciples, whom I have chosen in these last days.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.4" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:4</a>. Italics added.) Then the Lord adds this great promise: “And they shall go forth and none shall stay them, for I the Lord have commanded them.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.5" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:5</a>.) The revelation further states that all these things he has given unto his disciple-missionaries “to publish unto you, O inhabitants of the earth.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:6</a>.) After declaring that his voice is unto the ends of the earth, the Lord points out that he, “knowing the calamity which should come upon the inhabitants of the earth, called upon my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and spake unto him from heaven. …” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.17" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:17</a>.) The same as in all other dispensations, a means of escape, revealed through a prophet, is provided. Then the Lord emphasizes that he is “willing to make these things known unto all flesh” for he is “no respecter of persons.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.34-35" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:34–35</a>.)</p>

Though heaven and earth pass away, his word he says, “shall not pass away, but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.38" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:38</a>.) Two days after receiving this great revelation from which I have quoted, the Lord said this to his church: “Send forth the elders of my church unto the nations which are afar off; unto the islands of the sea; send forth unto foreign lands; call upon all nations. …” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/133.8" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 133:8</a>.)</p>

We are happy to be engaged in a partnership with our Heavenly Father in the great work of the salvation and exaltation of his children. Willingly we give of our time and our means with which he may bless us to the establishment of his kingdom in the earth. This we know is our first duty and our great opportunity. This spirit has characterized the missionary work of the church of Jesus Christ in all ages. It has been an outstanding mark of the ushering in of the dispensation of the fulness of times—our time. Wherever faithful Latter-day Saints are to be found, this spirit of unselfish sacrifice for the greatest cause in all the earth exists. In a statement published to the world during the last world war, the First Presidency of the Church declared: “No act of ours or of the Church must ever interfere with this God-given mandate.” (<span class="emphasis">Conference Report,</span> April 1942, p. 91.)</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/do-not-despair.p2" pid="-vDyGUEUCEKEhDFszyiLUA" hash="ejguJQ">It is my hope and prayer that what I am about to say will be helpful, both physically and spiritually, in the difficult days ahead.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/do-not-despair.p3" pid="7GgWGEm_ykqJImknMJ7yIw" hash="Lsf1xg">We live in an age when, as the Lord foretold, men’s hearts are failing them, not only physically but in spirit. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.26" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 45:26</a>.) Many are giving up heart for the battle of life. Suicide ranks as a major cause of the deaths to college students. As the showdown between good and evil approaches with its accompanying trials and tribulations, Satan is increasingly striving to overcome the Saints with despair, discouragement, despondency, and depression.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/do-not-despair.p4" pid="ZDHfwOtieUaXgpX3yb7pPg" hash="JE7Wrw">Yet, of all people, we as Latter-day Saints should be the most optimistic and the least pessimistic. For while we know that “peace shall be taken from the earth, and the devil shall have power over his own dominion,” we are also assured that “the Lord shall have power over his saints, and shall reign in their midst.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.35-36" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:35–36</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/do-not-despair.p5" pid="C4qCQUd_Xka9WztYytZueA" hash="wGXDIg">With the assurance that the Church shall remain intact with God directing it through the troubled times ahead, it then becomes our individual responsibility to see that each of us remains faithful to the Church and its teachings. “He that remaineth steadfast and is not overcome, the same shall be saved.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-m/1.11" class="scriptureRef">JS—M 1:11</a>.) To help us from being overcome by the devil’s designs of despair, discouragement, depression, and despondency, the Lord has provided at least a dozen ways which, if followed, will lift our spirits and send us on our way rejoicing.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/do-not-despair.p6" pid="ex3iPS-GZUmqKmcgW-eoLw" hash="7gbXwQ">First, repentance. In the Book of Mormon we read that “despair cometh because of iniquity.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.22" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 10:22</a>.) “When I do good I feel good,” said Abraham Lincoln, “and when I do bad I feel bad.” Sin pulls a man down into despondency and despair. While a man may take some temporary pleasure in sin, the end result is unhappiness. “Wickedness never was happiness.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/41.10" class="scriptureRef">Alma 41:10</a>.) Sin creates disharmony with God and is depressing to the spirit. Therefore, a man would do well to examine himself to see that he is in harmony with all of God’s laws. Every law kept brings a particular blessing. Every law broken brings a particular blight. Those who are heavy laden with despair should come unto the Lord, for his yoke is easy and his burden is light. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/11.28-30" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 11:28–30</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/do-not-despair.p7" pid="l6fBmKB3NUu327vGuxLHkw" hash="s0JCbg">Second, prayer. Prayer in the hour of need is a great boon. From simple trials to our Gethsemanes, prayer can put us in touch with God, our greatest source of comfort and counsel. “Pray always, that you may come off conqueror” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/10.5" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 10:5</a>)—persistent prayer. “Exerting all my powers to call upon God to deliver me” is how the young Joseph Smith describes the method which he used in the Sacred Grove to keep the adversary from destroying him. (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.16" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:16</a>.) This is also a key to use in keeping depression from destroying us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/do-not-despair.p8" pid="ht27QyQvNk2O3iXK7ZyWAg" hash="TuyiTA">Third, service. To lose yourself in righteous service to others can lift your sights and get your mind off personal problems, or at least put them in proper focus. “When you find yourselves a little gloomy,” said President Lorenzo Snow, “look around you and find somebody that is in a worse plight than yourself; go to him and find out what the trouble is, then try to remove it with the wisdom which the Lord bestows upon you; and the first thing you know, your gloom is gone, you feel light, the Spirit of the Lord is upon you, and everything seems illuminated.” (<span class="emphasis">Conference Report,</span> 6 Apr. 1899, pp. 2–3.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/do-not-despair.p9" pid="VyGAeSBS2UCBiUnhrO8o_Q" hash="mYLUnA">A woman whose life is involved in the righteous rearing of her children has a better chance of keeping up her spirits than the woman whose total concern is centered in her own personal problems.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/do-not-despair.p10" pid="swccKZATZ0mrmM_9I7lBMA" hash="jv0pUA">Fourth, work. The earth was cursed for Adam’s sake. Work is our blessing, not our doom. God has a work to do, and so should we. Retirement from work has depressed many a man and hastened his death. It has been said that even the very fiends weave ropes of sand rather than to face the pure hell of idleness. We should work at taking care of the spiritual, mental, social, and physical needs of ourselves and those whom we are charged to help. In the church of Jesus Christ there is plenty of work to do to move forward the kingdom of God. Every member a missionary, family genealogy and temple work, home evenings, receiving a Church assignment and magnifying it are but a few of our required labors.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/do-not-despair.p11" pid="yexxlSDIhE-YqPSYc5Pw8w" hash="3jy5JQ">Fifth, health. The condition of the physical body can affect the spirit. That’s why the Lord gave us the Word of Wisdom. He also said that we should retire to our beds early and arise early (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.124" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:124</a>), that we should not run faster than we have strength (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/10.4" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 10:4</a>), and that we should use moderation in all good things. In general, the more food we eat in its natural state and the less it is refined without additives, the healthier it will be for us. Food can affect the mind, and deficiencies in certain elements in the body can promote mental depression. A good physical examination periodically is a safeguard and may spot problems that can be remedied. Rest and physical exercise are essential, and a walk in the fresh air can refresh the spirit. Wholesome recreation is part of our religion, and a change of pace is necessary, and even its anticipation can lift the spirit.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/do-not-despair.p12" pid="hgF49tvDO0mvrixSgauGAQ" hash="feYbQQ">Sixth, reading. Many a man in his hour of trial has turned to the Book of Mormon and been enlightened, enlivened, and comforted.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/do-not-despair.p13" pid="Z3V580pgQ0WhP2QZm_ioIw" hash="wE5dsA">The psalms in the Old Testament have a special food for the soul of one in distress. In our day we are blessed with the Doctrine and Covenants, modern revelation. The words of the prophets, particularly the living president of the Church, are crucial reading and can give direction and comfort in an hour when one is down.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/do-not-despair.p14" pid="KrNxrbJ64E-7P4PjDYoIMQ" hash="iYENFA">Seventh, blessing. In a particularly stressful time, or in the anticipation of a critical event, one can seek for a blessing under the hands of the priesthood. Even the Prophet Joseph Smith sought and received a blessing under the hands of Brigham Young and received solace and direction for his soul. Fathers, so live that you can bless your own wives and children. To receive, and then consistently and prayerfully ponder, one’s patriarchal blessing can give helpful insight, particularly in an hour of need. The sacrament will “bless … the souls” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.77,79" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:77, 79</a>) of all those who worthily partake of it, and as such it should be taken often, even by the bedfast.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/do-not-despair.p15" pid="79AoQKNtvUG5U1ERhAQQPA" hash="Beb_Ag">Eighth, fasting. A certain kind of devil goes not out except by fasting and prayer, the scripture tells us. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/17.21" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 17:21</a>.) Periodic fasting can help clear up the mind and strengthen the body and the spirit. The usual fast, the one we are asked to participate in for fast Sunday, is for 24 hours without food or drink. Some people, feeling the need, have gone on longer fasts of abstaining from food but have taken the needed liquids. Wisdom should be used, and the fast should be broken with light eating. To make a fast most fruitful, it should be coupled with prayer and meditation; physical work should be held to a minimum, and it’s a blessing if one can ponder on the scriptures and the reason for the fast.</p>

The fellowship of true friends who can hear you out, share your joys, help carry your burdens, and correctly counsel you is priceless. For one who has been in the prison of depression, the words of the Prophet Joseph Smith have special meaning when he said, “How sweet the voice of a friend is; one token of friendship from any source whatever awakens and calls into action every sympathetic feeling.” (<span class="emphasis">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</span> p. 134.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/do-not-despair.p17" pid="IVtPLe8Lk0-oZSsTID24qg" hash="29EhMg">Ideally, your family ought to be your closest friends. Most important, we should seek to become the friend of our Father in heaven and our brother Jesus the Christ. What a boon to be in the company of those who edify you. To have friends, one should be friendly. Friendship should begin at home and then be extended to encompass the home teacher, quorum leader, bishop, and other Church teachers and leaders. To meet often with the Saints and enjoy their companionship can buoy up the heart.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/do-not-despair.p18" pid="zlwflahLN02pFhjCMsJeAA" hash="RClwwA">Tenth, music. Inspiring music may fill the soul with heavenly thoughts, move one to righteous action, or speak peace to the soul. When Saul was troubled with an evil spirit, David played for him with his harp and Saul was refreshed and the evil spirit departed. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/1-sam/16.23" class="scriptureRef">1 Sam. 16:23</a>.) Elder Boyd K. Packer has wisely suggested memorizing some of the inspiring songs of Zion and then, when the mind is afflicted with temptations, to sing aloud, to keep before your mind the inspiring words and thus crowd out the evil thoughts. (See <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Jan. 1974, p. 28.) This could also be done to crowd out debilitating, depressive thoughts.</p>

Smith was very ill, he was visited by his cousin, the Prophet Joseph Smith. The afflicted man reported: “He [the Prophet] told me I should never get discouraged, whatever difficulties might surround me. If I were sunk into the lowest pit of Nova Scotia and all the Rocky Mountains piled on top of me, I ought not to be discouraged, but hang on, exercise faith, and keep up good courage, and I should come out on the top of the heap.” (<span class="emphasis">George A. Smith Family,</span> comp. Zora Smith Jarvis, Provo, Utah: Brigham Young University Press, 1962, p. 54.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/do-not-despair.p20" pid="LJex2FfzVE2hbu6mAQAgAw" hash="7QLNLw">There are times when you simply have to righteously hang on and outlast the devil until his depressive spirit leaves you. As the Lord told the Prophet Joseph Smith: “Thine adversity and thine afflictions, shall be but a small moment;</p>

Even our master Jesus the Christ, while facing that supreme test of being temporarily left alone by our Father during the crucifixion, continued performing his labors for the children of men, and then shortly thereafter he was glorified and received a fullness of joy. While you are going through your trial, you can recall your past victories and count the blessings that you do have with a sure hope of greater ones to follow if you are faithful. And you can have that certain knowledge that in due time God will wipe away all tears and that “eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2.9" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 2:9</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/do-not-despair.p23" pid="QfVEjhpiKUm1Gqi8m5MSKw" hash="Xd461A">And twelfth, goals. Every accountable child of God needs to set goals, short- and long-range goals. A man who is pressing forward to accomplish worthy goals can soon put despondency under his feet, and once a goal is accomplished, others can be set up. Some will be continuing goals. Each week when we partake of the sacrament we commit ourselves to the goals of taking upon ourselves the name of Christ, of always remembering him and keeping his commandments. Of Jesus’ preparation for his mission, the scripture states that he “increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/2.52" class="scriptureRef">Luke 2:52</a>.) This encompasses four main areas for goals: spiritual, mental, physical, and social. “Therefore, what manner of men ought ye to be?” asked the Master, and he answered, “Verily I say unto you, even as I am.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.27" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 27:27</a>.) Now there is a lifetime goal—to walk in his steps, to perfect ourselves in every virtue as he has done, to seek his face, and to work to make our calling and election sure.</p>

(<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6.36" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 6:36</a>.) And what will follow if we do? “Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/26.3" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 26:3</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/do-not-despair.p27" pid="-G-6Mtq0P0yfJoR3Z42oRw" hash="-CuLZQ">“Salvation,” said the Prophet Joseph Smith, “is nothing more nor less than to triumph over all our enemies and put them under our feet.” (<span class="emphasis">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</span> p. 297.) We can rise above the enemies of despair, depression, discouragement, and despondency by remembering that God provides righteous alternatives, some of which I have mentioned. As it states in the Bible, “There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/10.13" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 10:13</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/do-not-despair.p28" pid="GcG66toxm0uQGhdmWFnwNw" hash="Egt8VA">Yes, life is a test; it is a probation; and perhaps being away from our heavenly home we feel sometimes, as holy men in the past have felt, that “they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.” (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.13" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 45:13</a>.)</p>

He made it to his goal, but in order to do so, he had to overcome many obstacles, one of which was to escape from the Giant Despair. To lift our spirit and send us on our way rejoicing, the devil’s designs of despair, discouragement, depression, and despondency can be defeated in a dozen ways, namely: repentance, prayer, service, work, health, reading, blessings, fasting, friends, music, endurance, and goals.</p>

Amen.</p>

Mormon, the ancient prophet after whom the book is named, abridged centuries of records. God, who knows the end from the beginning, told him what to include in his abridgment that we would need for our day. Mormon turned the records over to his son Moroni, the last recorder; and Moroni, writing over 1,500 years ago but speaking to us today, states: “Behold, I speak unto you as if ye were present, and yet ye are not.

First, it tells in a plain manner of Christ and his gospel. It testifies of his divinity and of the necessity for a Redeemer and the need of our putting trust in him. It bears witness of the Fall and the Atonement and the first principles of the gospel, including our need of a broken heart and a contrite spirit and a spiritual rebirth. It proclaims we must endure to the end in righteousness and live the moral life of a Saint.</p>

It confounds false doctrines and lays down contention. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3.12" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 3:12</a>.) It fortifies the humble followers of Christ against the evil designs, strategies, and doctrines of the devil in our day. The type of apostates in the Book of Mormon are similar to the type we have today. God, with his infinite foreknowledge, so molded the Book of Mormon that we might see the error and know how to combat false educational, political, religious, and philosophical concepts of our time.</p>

God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ revealed themselves to Joseph Smith in a marvelous vision. After that glorious event, Joseph Smith told a minister about it. Joseph was surprised to hear the minister say that there were no such things as visions or revelations in these days, that all such things had ceased.

Namely, they do not believe that God reveals his will today to the Church through prophets of God. All objections, whether they be on abortion, plural marriage, seventh-day worship, etc., basically hinge on whether Joseph Smith and his successors were and are prophets of God receiving divine revelation. Here, then, is a procedure to handle most objections through the use of the Book of Mormon.</p>

It shows that Joseph Smith was a prophet. It contains the words of Christ, and its great mission is to bring men to Christ and all other things are secondary. The golden question of the Book of Mormon is “Do you want to learn more of Christ?” The Book of Mormon is the great finder of the golden contact. It does not contain things which are “pleasing unto the world” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/6.5" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 6:5</a>), and so the worldly are not interested in it. It is a great sieve.</p>

Our homes are not as strong unless we are using it to bring our children to Christ. Our families may be corrupted by worldly trends and teachings unless we know how to use the book to expose and combat the falsehoods in socialism, organic evolution, rationalism, humanism, etc. Our missionaries are not as effective unless they are “hissing forth” with it. Social, ethical, cultural, or educational converts will not survive under the heat of the day unless their taproots go down to the fulness of the gospel which the Book of Mormon contains. Our Church classes are not as spirit-filled unless we hold it up as a standard. And our nation will continue to degenerate unless we read and heed the words of the God of this land, Jesus Christ, and quit building up and upholding the secret combinations which the Book of Mormon tells us proved the downfall of both previous American civilizations.</p>

As a result, their minds had been darkened. The Lord said that this kind of treatment of the Book of Mormon brought the whole Church under condemnation, even all of the children of Zion. And then the Lord said, “And they shall remain under this condemnation until they repent and remember the new covenant, even the Book of Mormon.” (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.54-57" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:54–57</a>.)

For thirty minutes each morning before I began the day’s work I read from the Book of Mormon . … and in just a few minutes a day I read the Book of Mormon through, every year, for nine years. I know that it kept me in harmony, so far as I did keep in harmony, with the Spirit of the Lord.” (<span class="emphasis">Conference Report,</span> Apr. 1949, p. 36.)

His church has been reestablished among men with all the spiritual gifts enjoyed anciently. All this is done in preparation for Christ’s second coming.

Much of the unbounded knowledge with which men have been blessed has been used to destroy mankind instead of to bless the children of men as the Lord intended. Two great world wars, with fruitless efforts at lasting peace, are solemn evidence that peace has been taken from the earth because of the wickedness of the people. Nations cannot endure in sin.

We call upon rulers and people alike to repent of their evil ways. Turn unto the Lord, seek his forgiveness, and unite yourselves in humility with his kingdom. There is no other way. If you will do this, your sins will be blotted out, peace will come and remain, and you will become a part of the kingdom of God in preparation for Christ’s second coming. But if you refuse to repent or to accept the testimony of his inspired messengers and unite yourselves with God’s kingdom, then the terrible judgments and calamities promised the wicked will be yours.</p>

The voice of warning is to all people by the mouths of his servants. If this voice is not heeded, the angels of destruction will increasingly go forth, and the chastening hand of Almighty God will be felt upon the nations, as decreed, until a full end thereof will be the result. Wars, devastation, and untold suffering will be your lot except you turn unto the Lord in humble repentance. Destruction, even more terrible and far-reaching than attended the last great war, will come with certainty unless rulers and people alike repent and cease their evil and godless ways. God will not be mocked. He will not permit the sins of sexual immorality, secret murderous combinations, the killing of the unborn, and disregard for all his holy commandments and the messages of his servants to go unheeded without grievous punishments for such wickedness. The nations of the world cannot endure in sin. The way of escape is clear. The immutable laws of God remain steadfastly in the heavens above. When men and nations refuse to abide by them, the penalty must follow. They will be wasted away. Sin demands punishment.</p>

During the struggle for independence, nearly 9,000 of the colonist forces were killed. Among those fifty-six patriots who had pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor by signing the Declaration of Independence, at least nine paid that price with their life’s blood.</p>

The Articles of Confederation had been adopted but proved to be ineffectual. Under this instrument, the nation was without a president, a head. There was a congress, but it was a body destitute of any power. There was no supreme court. The states were merely a confederation.</p>

Fitzpatrick, ed., <span class="emphasis">Writings of George Washington,</span> Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1939, 29:68.) Because of this crisis, fifty-five of the seventy-four appointed delegates reported to the convention, representing every state except Rhode Island, for the purpose of forming “a more perfect union.” Thirty-nine finally signed the Constitution.</p>

They were mostly young men in the prime of their life, their average age being forty-four. Benjamin Franklin was the eldest at eighty-one. George Washington, the presiding officer at the convention, was fifty-five. Alexander Hamilton was only thirty-two; James Madison, who recorded the proceedings of the convention with his remarkable <span class="emphasis">Notes,</span> was only thirty-six. These were young men, but men of exceptional character, “sober, seasoned, distinguished men of affairs, drawn from various walks of life.” (J. Reuben Clark, Jr., <span class="emphasis">Stand Fast by Our Constitution,</span> Deseret Book Co., 1965, p. 135.)</p>

Four had been on Washington’s personal staff during the war. Among that assembly of the thirty-nine signers were to be found two future presidents of the United States, one the “Father of his Country”; a vice-president of the United States; a secretary of the treasury; a secretary of war; a secretary of state; two chief justices of the Supreme Court, and three who served as justices; and the venerable Franklin, a diplomat, philosopher, scientist, and statesman.</p>

In 1787 three states ratified the Constitution. In the next year eight more followed; and on April 6, 1789, 187 years ago today, the Constitution of the United States went into operation as the basic law of the United States when the electoral college unanimously elected George Washington as the first president of the nation. This date, I believe, was not accidental.</p>

Congress, however, could override the veto, and by its means of initiative in taxation, could further restrain the executive department. The Supreme Court could nullify laws passed by the Congress and signed by the president. But Congress could limit the Court’s appellate jurisdiction. The president could appoint judges for their lifetime with the consent of the Senate.</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-priceless-heritage.p6" pid="CQ704MsfckCPAfz70PjRRg" hash="q9lJow">The Declaration of Independence to which these great men affixed their signatures is much more than a political document. It constitutes a spiritual manifesto—revelation, if you will—declaring not for this nation only, but for all nations, the source of man’s rights. Nephi, a Book of Mormon prophet, foresaw over 2,300 years ago that this event would transpire. The colonies he saw would break with Great Britain and that “the power of the Lord was with [the colonists],” that they “were delivered by the power of God out of the hands of all other nations.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13.16,19" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 13:16, 19</a>.)</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-priceless-heritage.p7" pid="qfzxvoqrjk-y4VwKgZY_nQ" hash="66u-sQ">The Declaration of Independence was to set forth the moral justification of a rebellion against a long-recognized political tradition—the divine right of kings. At issue was the fundamental question of whether men’s rights were God-given or whether these rights were to be dispensed by governments to their subjects. This document proclaimed that <span class="emphasis">all</span> men have certain inalienable rights. In other words, these rights came from God. Therefore, the colonists were not rebels against political authority, but a free people only exercising their rights before an offending, usurping power. They were thus morally justified to do what they did.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-priceless-heritage.p8" pid="kSYTQ9zRt02ZD-rjk6Eyng" hash="avVk4A">Finally, the document concludes with this pledge. “For the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, <span class="emphasis">we mutually pledge to each other our Lives,</span><span class="emphasis">our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.</span>” (Italics added.)</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-priceless-heritage.p9" pid="Ei7b8yQND0CJknz0pYmksA" hash="l21_yA">How prophetic that pledge was to be!</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-priceless-heritage.p10" pid="QGfYn4seEEeMh8fn6URA6w" hash="R0W9YA">Fifty-six men signed the document on August 2, 1776, or, in the case of some, shortly thereafter. They pledged their lives!—and at least nine of them died as a result of the war. If the Revolution had failed, if their fight had come to naught, they would have been hanged as traitors. They pledged their fortunes!—and at least fifteen fulfilled that pledge to support the war effort. They pledged their sacred honor!—best expressed by the noble statement of John Adams. He said: “All that I have, and all that I am, and all that I hope, in this life, I am now ready here to stake upon it; and I leave off as I begun, that live or die, survive or perish, I am for the Declaration. It is my living sentiment, and by the blessing of God it shall be my dying sentiment, Independence, <span class="emphasis">now,</span> and <span class="emphasis">INDEPENDENCE FOR EVER.</span>” (<span class="emphasis">Works of Daniel Webster,</span> Boston: Little, Brown &amp; Co., 1877, 17th ed., 1:135.)</p>

Apostle Wilford Woodruff was president of the St. George Temple at the time of their appearance and testified that the founders of our republic declared this to him: “We laid the foundation of the government you now enjoy, and we never apostatized from it, but we remained true to it and were faithful to God.” (<span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> 19:229.)</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-priceless-heritage.p13" pid="_jwzDSWTM0a56eWiI5uhFA" hash="7mc8aw">Later, after he became President of the Church, President Woodruff declared that “those men who laid the foundation of this American government and signed the Declaration of Independence were the best spirits the God of heaven could find on the face of the earth. They were choice spirits, not wicked men. General Washington and all the men who labored for the purpose were inspired of the Lord.” (<span class="emphasis">Conference Report,</span> April 1898, p. 89.)</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-priceless-heritage.p14" pid="0cGKFzoiuUKHvMjty75GLg" hash="IwsttQ">Yes, I thank God for the sacrifices and efforts made by these Founding Fathers, whose efforts have brought us the blessings of political liberty and economic prosperity we have today. Their lives should be reminders that we are the blessed beneficiaries of a liberty earned by great sacrifices of property, reputation, and life.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-priceless-heritage.p15" pid="Q6ZvaNN9kkWxnDZZZnOUgA" hash="cp8pkw">Other great stalwarts who also pledged lives, possessions, and their sacred honor were the Mormon pioneers. This they did by covenant before God when they came to membership in His kingdom, “to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places … even unto death.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.9" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 18:9</a>.)</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-priceless-heritage.p16" pid="1SYTwIhJnE-4X6m3xcJi3Q" hash="mc9cug">Our Mormon forebears covenanted their lives!—and not a few gave them. The following places hallow the memory of the latter-day martyrs: Jackson County; Crooked River (where one of the Twelve was martyred); Haun’s Mill; Carthage; Nauvoo; and the unmarked graves along the Mormon trail. They gave their fortunes!—and many, if not most, lost their lands, homes, and businesses. They gave their sacred honor!—this by covenant to God.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-priceless-heritage.p17" pid="kaXjA_bGekWxFEPMOV2l9w" hash="GiHLuA">They came west with the faith that God had “set his hand again the second time” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/21.11" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 21:11</a>) to restore the house of Israel. They knew that they were a part of this great movement. They were converted to the truth that the Church of Jesus Christ had been restored again on the earth through the instrumentality of a latter-day Prophet, Joseph Smith, and that following his martyrdom, the keys of the priesthood had been continued through Joseph’s ordained successor, Brigham Young. They believed themselves to be God-directed and prophet-led. Their conviction inspired their sacrifices.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-priceless-heritage.p18" pid="A1bXEFEZI0CUkvv5NurIzw" hash="JZYNoA">They came—with indomitable faith and courage, following incredible suffering and adversity. They came—with stamina, with inspired confidence for better days.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-priceless-heritage.p19" pid="YKKvSE86NUCeSAQirn5htQ" hash="Kz6uqQ">Yes, they came—first the main caravan of 143 men, 3 women, and 2 children on July 24, 1847. This trickle of immigrants was followed by the hundreds, then the thousands, all seeking a home in safety. Yes, they came and carved an Eden out of the desert. Their promised land has become our prosperous valleys.</p>

				<span class="emphasis">First: They would counsel us to have faith in God.</span> It was by this faith that both were sustained in their privations, sacrifices, and sufferings. They placed their trust in God. He was their defense, their refuge, and their salvation. Their faith is perhaps best expressed by the founder of our country, George Washington:</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-priceless-heritage.p23" pid="Ae8_o6F9aEavZzR4WOAu3g" hash="MJS6uQ">“The success, which has hitherto attended our united efforts we owe to the gracious interposition of Heaven.

				<span class="emphasis">Second: They would counsel us to strengthen our homes and family ties.</span> Though they did not possess our physical comforts, they left their posterity a legacy of something more enduring—a hearthside where parents were close by their children, where daily devotions, family prayer, scripture reading, and the singing of hymns was commonplace. Families worked, worshipped, played, and prayed together. Family home evening, now a once-a-week practice among the Saints, was to our pioneer forebears almost a nightly occurrence.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-priceless-heritage.p26" pid="P64zdvC0lkmpuP4VwMrAiQ" hash="t1ruGQ">Can we not see in their examples the solutions to problems threatening families today? Were we to pattern our homes accordingly, divorce would be largely eliminated, children would be welcomed and guided, and love between parents and children would abound. There would be no generation gap. Family unity and solidarity, crowned with love and happiness, would prevail.</p>

				<span class="emphasis">Third: They would counsel us on the dignity of work, to practice thrift, and to be self-sustaining.</span> Theirs was a philosophy that neither the world nor the government owes a man his bread. Man is commanded of God to live by the sweat of <span class="emphasis">his</span> brow, not someone else’s. In Thomas Jefferson’s First Inaugural Address, he counseled us toward a wise and frugal government, one which “shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it had earned.” (<span class="emphasis">Inaugural Addresses of the Presidents of the United States,</span> U.S. Government Printing Office, 1961, p. 15.)</p>

				<span class="emphasis">And finally: These noble Founders and pioneers—our benefactors—would counsel us to preserve the freedoms granted to us by God.</span> They knew that the foundation of this nation was spiritual, that the source of all our blessings was God.

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-priceless-heritage.p35" pid="v4hDGOlslEq0toDuRJ-xRg" hash="HQVfBA">Those intrepid forebears knew that their righteousness was the indispensable ingredient to liberty, that this was the greatest legacy they could pass on to future generations.

Beneath the placard was the inscription, “Not beaten there by the hammer and sickle, but freely, responsibly, confidently. … We need fear nothing or no one save God.”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-priceless-heritage.p38" pid="IJyAJsfvlESHu4wYwTiVQQ" hash="93smmg">That picture has stayed in my memory ever since: America on her knees in recognition that all our blessings come from God! America on her knees out of a desire to serve the God of this land by keeping His commandments! America on her knees, not driven there in capitulation to some despotic government, but on her knees freely, willingly, gratefully! This is the sovereign remedy to all of our problems and the preservation of our liberties.</p>

When I was a young missionary in Northern England in 1922, the opposition to the Church became very intense. The opposition became so strong that the mission president asked that we discontinue all street meetings, and in some cases tracting was discontinued.</p>

My companion had planned to talk on the first principles. I had studied much in preparation for a talk on the apostasy. There was a wonderful spirit in the meeting. My companion spoke first and gave an inspirational message. I responded and talked with a freedom I had never experienced before in my life. When I sat down, I then realized that I had not mentioned the apostasy. I had talked on the Prophet Joseph Smith and borne my witness of his divine mission and to the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon. After the meeting had ended, several people came forward, some of them being nonmembers, and said, “Tonight we received a witness that the gospel is true as you elders teach it. We are now ready for baptism.”</p>

We then went back into the building and found a different officer at the appointment post. In less than fifteen minutes we were in the presence of the general. We had prayed that we would be able to see him and to touch his heart, knowing that all relief supplies contributed from any source were then required to be placed in the hands of the military for distribution. Our objective, as we explained it to the general, was to distribute our own supplies to our own people through our own channels, and also to make gifts for general child feeding.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/prayer.p33" pid="YjgscocmTE2Gojc9-pejxg" hash="Ew-6nQ">We explained the welfare program and how it operated.

Within twenty-four hours from the time we wire the First Presidency of the Church in Salt Lake City, carloads of supplies will be rolling toward Germany.

There is no place for fear among men and women who place their trust in the Almighty, who do not hesitate to humble themselves in seeking divine guidance through prayer. Though persecutions arise, though reverses come, in prayer we can find reassurance, for God will speak peace to the soul. That peace, that spirit of serenity, is life’s greatest blessing.</p>

Many have followed that counsel; some have turned a deaf ear to it. Times and circumstances cause us to repeat what the Lord said to the Prophet Joseph Smith in March 1832:</p>

Bishops storehouses are Church-owned facilities from which local bishops obtain food, clothing, and other commodities to care for the poor and needy who are unable to care for themselves. Deseret Industries are used as storehouses to provide nonfood commodities. Each bishop in the Church should have access to a local storehouse stocked with essential commodities produced in the program to meet the needs of his people.</p>

Later, the Lord instructed that the Presiding Bishop “appoint a storehouse unto this church; and let all things both in money and in [food], which are more than is needful for the wants of this people, be kept in the hands of the bishop.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/51.13" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 51:13</a>.)</p>

These storehouses are used for almost the identical purpose they were used for under the united order. Members consecrate their time and talents and means to produce, process, package, manufacture, and purchase commodities to care for those in need. To stock these storehouses, members of more than 3,000 Latter-day Saint wards throughout the Church participate in production and processing projects producing vegetables, grains, fruits, and other food and nonfood items. Some of these commodities are sold on the open market to pay operating costs. The balance of these commodities are kept in and distributed through the storehouse system to those in need. Total assistance through storehouses during 1976 amounted to several millions of dollars.</p>

Storehouses are only established to care for the poor and the needy. For this reason, members of the Church have been instructed to personally store a year’s supply of food, clothing, and, where possible, fuel. By following this counsel, most members will be prepared and able to care for themselves and their family members, and be able to share with others as may be needed.</p>

Once the poor and needy are sought out in his ward, the specific needs of individuals should be identified. This may be done with the help of the priesthood and Relief Society leaders. A bishop should then assess these needs, ensuring that each individual cares for himself and that families take care of family members who cannot care for themselves.</p>

The best management should be used to care for the Lord’s property. Authorized storehouse personnel are to issue appropriate receipts for contributed commodities and cash. At least a year’s supply of nonperishable commodities are to be kept on hand. Surpluses must be appropriately cared for to avoid spoilage and waste. Storehouse keepers should check all processed food as it is received to see that it is season-dated and meets preestablished quality standards. All stocks are to be rotated as required to maintain quality and to avoid waste. In all cases, storehouses must be maintained and kept neat. Each storehouse should be a model to the Lord of efficiency, cleanliness, and service.</p>

At the present time, the General Welfare Committee is initiating an expansion program to establish more production and processing projects and to build more storehouses. The Welfare Services Department, under the direction of the Area General Authority Supervisors, Regional Representatives of the Twelve, and area and regional welfare leaders, will be providing local direction to the effort. Should you have questions in this regard, please direct them to the appropriate priesthood officer.</p>

Before you begin any fund-raising for a storehouse, seek counsel. Establish carefully planned goals. Know where you are going and why before you start. In the work of the Lord there should be no serious mistakes. The most important point of your planning should be on your knees. As we expand the storehouse system, there should be nothing done to damage the image of the Church.</p>

That stated purpose is “to set up, insofar as it might be possible, a system under which the curse of idleness would be done away with, the evils of a dole abolished, and independence, industry, thrift, and self-respect be once more established amongst our people. The aim of the Church is to help the people to help themselves. Work is to be re-enthroned as the ruling principle of the lives of our Church membership.” (President Heber J. Grant, as quoted in <span class="emphasis">Welfare Services Handbook,</span> 1973, p. 1.)</p>

When meaningful jobs are not provided, when people are not encouraged to work, a demoralizing Church dole would develop, and the purpose for which the welfare program was established would be undermined. It is a law of heaven, and one we haven’t learned fully here on earth, that you cannot help people permanently by doing for them what they can do, and should do, for themselves.</p>

Commodity needs should be satisfied by using storehouse commodities. In all cases where assistance is provided, those who receive the assistance should work to the extent of their ability to earn what they receive. Work assignments should be made by assigned bishops’ counselors or by the assigned Relief Society counselor. Commodities should be used wherever possible instead of cash fast offering assistance. By using storehouse commodities instead of fast offerings, the flow of commodities through the welfare system is ensured, production is encouraged, and waste is eliminated. Even more importantly, in keeping with the Lord’s instructions cited as my text, the Church will stand “independent above all other creatures beneath the celestial world.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/78.14" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 78:14</a>.)

Let me restate what is a fundamental principle. Individuals, to the extent possible, should provide for their own needs. Where the individual is unable to care for himself, his family should assist. Where the family is not able to provide, the Church should render assistance, not the government. We accept the basic principle that “though the people support the government, the government should not support the people.”</p>

This includes food stamps. Priesthood and Relief Society leaders should urge members to accept the Church welfare program and earn through the program that which they need, even though they may receive less food and money. By doing so, members will be spiritually strengthened, and they will maintain their dignity and self-respect.</p>

With revelation and prophecy as our guide, I think it is not extreme for me to say that when all is written about our present generation, it may truly be said that we had hardly enough time to prepare.

These reporters were somewhat informed and appeared amazed about the Church’s growth and progress as measured by the increase of converts. I said to them, “We’re grateful for this rapid growth in numbers. But we are even more grateful for the growth in faith and spirituality.” I then quoted some statistics in support of that statement. When I first came into the Council of the Twelve in 1943, I said, the average attendance at sacrament meeting—our Sunday preaching service—was about 20 percent. Today worldwide attendance is about 41 percent. Youth attendance is 46 percent, and attendance in the Primary—our young children—is 67 percent. The growth, progress, and increased spirituality of the members of the Church is not just accidental, I said to them. It is the result of a rich program based on eternal truth.</p>

          <p pid="H06-2U7u40q-k8LaV4hWFg" hash="zd0-2A">The four-generation program has changed in a very significant way. In the past each individual was responsible for the submission of his or her four-generation family group record forms. December 1978 marks the end of the old (current) four-generation program. Beginning July 1979, the Church will accept newly prepared pedigree charts and family group record forms from family organizations, rather than from individuals. In the interim between now and July 1979, members of the Church are encouraged to organize as families—each individual with his brothers, sisters, and parents—to compare the information on the family group sheets which they have in common, check the accuracy of the information, verify the dates, and formulate <span class="emphasis">one</span> record to be submitted on behalf of <span class="emphasis">all</span> family members appearing on the group sheet. This process repeats itself next with the parents (if still living), and so on until all generations are completed, verified, and corrected as necessary. You can readily see the importance of the family organization.</p>

          <p pid="RStClaMbAEWE8rXLynl5NA" hash="af-tDg">A second major change is that original research beyond the four-generation level will be accepted but will no longer be required of individual members or individual families in the Church. Instead, the Church has assumed the responsibility to begin a massive record-gathering and extraction program in order to prepare names for temple work.</p>

It solves the immediate need to provide many more names for the operation of the temples.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/worthy-of-all-acceptation.p7" pid="kQPOkuHumEKLcyIqIE97qA" hash="P7Fvjg">In the past it was not uncommon for family organizations to spend an inordinate amount of time, money, and effort in search of a given ancestor. Now it would seem that once a reasonable, conventional effort has been made to locate a given ancestor, if he or she cannot be found, the family organization can assume its responsibility completed and move on to the next line or ancestor in question, leaving the processing of the unidentifiable ancestor to the extraction/indexing program.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/worthy-of-all-acceptation.p8" pid="XLTY0zWVukiA-SbSGpTS6g" hash="J2axHQ">Now may I say a word about ancestral-type family organizations. Ancestral family organizations are comprised of descendants of a common ancestral couple. The major purpose for organizing or perpetuating an ancestral family organization is to coordinate genealogical activity on common ancestral lines. When ancestral family organizations deviate from this major objective and seek primarily to provide social, cultural, or other types of activities, they take over the legitimate domain of the immediate and grandparent organizations. With the change announced by President Kimball, a gradual but definite transition should occur so that the genealogical work in progress is completed. The immediate and grandparent family organizations should then be assigned the responsibility of reunions and soliciting of funds.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/worthy-of-all-acceptation.p9" pid="FpgVPhXH6U6aiLhtjLqNQw" hash="0AJFbQ">Another legitimate function of the ancestral organization is to provide resource material from which the immediate and grandparent family organizations can draw to complete family histories—especially on their first four generations. Thus the ancestral organizations may accumulate, properly file, catalog, and preserve histories, photographs, letters, manuscripts, diaries, journals, and published books.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/worthy-of-all-acceptation.p10" pid="J12UrTAGhkObCVt_j3cjMw" hash="sodNwQ">Again, I emphasize that every family in the Church should belong to an immediate and, insofar as possible, a grandparent family organization. Ancestral organizations exist only for the coordination of genealogical activity, which includes family histories. Once this function has been accomplished the ancestral family organization might well be dissolved, or at least reduced in importance, in favor of the immediate and grandparent organizations.</p>

We have taken pains to have them reproduced by offset press so that the quality of the print would encourage use and reading. It is also our intent to add pictures of each ancestor to his or her history.

Though the Missionary Department recommends that each young man bring at least six white shirts with him, most of these foreign-born missionaries, these sons of Lehi, bring one, possibly two. But they also bring to this service a great commitment and love for the Lord. And their blessings will exceed any sacrifice they have made. We can never get the Lord in debt to us.</p>

As with other matters of faithfulness in gospel living, being married the Lord’s way takes a willingness to deny yourself ungodliness—worldliness—and a determination to do our Father’s will. By this act of faith, we show our love to God and our regard for a posterity yet unborn. As our family is our greatest source of joy in this life, so it may well be in the eternity.</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/church-government-through-councils.p" pid="BoWZ3TF_BkaMJzSxjaAT7w" hash="-JovvQ">My beloved brethren and sisters, as President Tanner has announced, we are pleased to announce today some developments affecting area and local Church administration. May I say at the outset that what you will see and hear is the result of months of prayerful study and deliberation. This presentation about Church councils is <span class="emphasis">not</span> a new program, but it is a reemphasis of a principle based on the scriptures and on traditional Church government procedures. Some of you who live in the United States will recognize in this presentation nothing more than what is already being done at your interim meetings.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/church-government-through-councils.p" pid="hsF9lFmw0EK1RwfpDKgjKQ" hash="QbLSyw">Because this is such an important matter, I will stay with a written text, using visuals as needed. As I begin, however, I want you to know that this presentation has the wholehearted endorsement of the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, the First Quorum of the Seventy, and the Presiding Bishopric. We have no doubt that what we are presenting to you today will greatly facilitate communication and unity at various Church levels and help move the kingdom forward.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/church-government-through-councils.p" pid="eD9xzhQ4uka5NMNgRcFb8g" hash="skUodA">Some background may be helpful so you can more completely understand the significance of these developments.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/church-government-through-councils.p" pid="SDLz3aXtAEeKMRFs75gR5w" hash="vBCLsQ">Throughout the history of the Church, it has been a practice that essentially ecclesiastical matters be administered by the Quorum of the Twelve and that essentially temporal affairs be administered by the Presiding Bishopric. This practice continues to this day.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/church-government-through-councils.p" pid="g6kGh06wuUuEK5Ll_J1gyw" hash="VS6bBQ">You are all, of course, familiar with the traditional administrative channel of authority to the field from the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, the Presidency of the First Quorum of the Seventy, Area Supervisors, Regional Representatives, stake presidents, and bishops. This channel of authority remains unchanged.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/church-government-through-councils.p" pid="Ni6PI9uPeU-CNJgCNYqBtA" hash="M_aDRg">More recently, because of the need to carefully manage temporal matters in the field, approval was given to have a Presiding Bishopric area supervisor in certain countries of the world. He has worked in close cooperation with the General Authority Area Supervisor and has reported his responsibilities on temporal matters to the Presiding Bishopric, who in turn report to the First Presidency.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/church-government-through-councils.p" pid="SuYOxKTMLUyCRI2ho6tkhA" hash="Nbih4A">The principle we desire to reemphasize was well expressed by President Stephen L Richards, first counselor to President David O. McKay, in these words:</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/church-government-through-councils.p" pid="AEoHpBKm60e6hL7jJpbEkQ" hash="mwL0dA">“As I conceive it, the genius of our Church government is government through <span class="emphasis">councils.</span> The Council of the Presidency, the Council of the Twelve, the Council of the Stake Presidency … the Council of the Bishopric. … I have had enough experience to know the value of councils. … I see the wisdom, God’s wisdom, in creating councils: to govern his Kingdom. In the spirit under which we labor, men can get together with seemingly divergent views and far different backgrounds, and under the operation of that spirit, by counseling together, they can arrive at an accord.” (In Conference Report, Oct. 1953, p. 86.)</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/church-government-through-councils.p" pid="Hj81jVIiTk2YHLoQCVM26Q" hash="f6Oz-g">The First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, and the Presiding Bishopric have determined to organize council meetings at the general Church level, the area level, and the region level. These councils will be called the Church Coordinating Council (at the general level), area council, multiregion council (<span class="emphasis">only</span> if needed), region council, and the presently existing stake and ward correlation councils.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/church-government-through-councils.p" pid="KlEaUMksWEacwoAow8GdSA" hash="qy2HsQ">We have felt that in order to be effective, these councils need to be <span class="emphasis">comprehensive</span> in representing <span class="emphasis">all</span> Church programs so that there will be a <span class="emphasis">correlating, coordinating, planning,</span> and <span class="emphasis">resolving</span> body at each of these levels. These councils, properly organized and functioning, assure a unified approach to the management of ecclesiastical and temporal affairs.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/church-government-through-councils.p" pid="XRLTCHRtNUWQ9U_rR-zqqQ" hash="hq4AVQ">It has also been determined that the General Authority Area Supervisor’s title will be changed to <span class="emphasis">executive administrator,</span> and outside of the United States and Canada, the Presiding Bishopric area supervisor’s title will be changed to <span class="emphasis">director for temporal affairs.</span> These title changes take effect immediately. In the United States and Canada the Presiding Bishopric will appoint individuals either from Church headquarters or from the local area to represent and manage temporal activities.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/church-government-through-councils.p" pid="7leEHEtEoEeo1u15iJ6hvg" hash="3OWtAw">Now may I say a word to all who will participate in the administration of these councils at the area, region, and other local levels. The Twelve continue to be vitally interested in temporal matters; the Presiding Bishopric continue to be vitally concerned with ecclesiastical matters. To us it is one great program. This division of responsibility is intended for administrative convenience. All things are spiritual to the Lord (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29.34" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 29:34</a>).</p>

This will help us meet the urgent need to balance the distribution of available resources (both time and money) which are to be given to various Church programs and efforts. For example, suppose recommendations from the combined area councils of the Church show a need for 800 buildings during a given year, but the Church has only time and money resources for 600 buildings. The Church Coordinating Council would then determine where resources are needed most.</p>

We seem to forget that the great objective of Communism is still world domination and control, which means the surrender of our freedom—your freedom—our sovereignty.</p>

Communism is the greatest anti-Christ power in the world today and therefore the greatest menace not only to our peace but to our preservation as a free people.

So, I say with all the energy of my soul that unless we as citizens of this nation forsake our sins, political and otherwise, and return to the fundamental principles of Christianity and of constitutional government, we will lose our political liberties, our free institutions, and will stand in jeopardy before God.</p>

He declared it would be a “marvelous work and a wonder” to all mankind (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/29.14" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 29:14</a>). When Jesus appeared to the Nephites in America, He confirmed the prophecy of Isaiah in these words: “For my sake shall the Father work a work, which shall be a great and a marvelous work” among the people of the land of America in the last days (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/21.9" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 21:9</a>).</p>

A small number of men and women, including the Prophet Joseph Smith, gathered in the home of Peter Whitmer, Sr., to witness and participate in the official organization of the Church. Today there are over 4 1/2 million members in eighty-one countries. We now look in retrospect on 150 years of the history of the Church and are led to exclaim with Isaiah, “Truly the work is marvelous and wonderful!”</p>

Jesus used the comparison of the small mustard seed to describe the early beginning of His church. But eventually, He declared, that insignificant seed would become a great tree and many would find refuge in its branches (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/13.31-32" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 13:31–32</a>).</p>

Wherever the tiny “mustard seed” was planted, attempts were made to frustrate its growth. But notwithstanding all the efforts to destroy the work—even the murder of the Prophet Joseph Smith and his brother—the Church prospered and grew. There were those who thought the Church would fail with the deaths of the martyrs Joseph and Hyrum, but they did not perceive, as Daniel foretold, that this latter-day kingdom should “never be destroyed” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/dan/2.44" class="scriptureRef">Dan. 2:44</a>).</p>

It is not just another human institution.

That is what this church endured and survived in the first sixty years of its history—and it was through such adversity, persecution, and impoverishment that the Church gained strength and matured. By the time Joseph F. Smith, the son of the Prophet Joseph’s brother Hyrum, became President, he could say, “We have passed through the stages of infancy … , and are indeed approaching … manhood and womanhood” (in Conference Report, Apr. 1909, p. 2).</p>

You have formed new affiliations, and now some of you have become disinterested in the Church and no longer conform to its standards. Unhappily, many of your families tread in your paths and follow your examples. Brethren, when we fail to be true to our priesthood promises, the price we and our loved ones are forced to pay might well be entitled “the high cost for low living.” What a blessing you would be to your wives and children if you would harmonize your lives with your covenants. O, brethren of the priesthood, how we need your support, affiliation, and strength! Do not desert the cause of God at a time when the conflict is most imminent. Make President John Taylor’s slogan your commitment: “The kingdom of God or nothing!” (in <span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> 6:26).</p>

Put aside your worldliness and renew your covenants. If you have differences with fellow members, go to them, or to your priesthood leaders, and talk them out. Don’t allow differences to canker your soul and set you in opposition to the Church. You will find your brethren waiting to put their arms around you and welcome you into fellowship. You are our brethren in the priesthood and we love you.</p>

Grant gave this counsel to the Saints: “Refrain from evil; do that which is good. Visit the sick, comfort those who are in sorrow, clothe the naked, feed the hungry, care for the widow and the fatherless. Observe the laws of health which the Lord has revealed, and keep yourselves unspotted from the sins of the world. Pay your tithes and offerings, and the Lord will open the windows of heaven and pour out blessings until there shall not be room to contain them. Be obedient to the laws of God and the civil laws of the country in which you reside, and uphold and honor those who are chosen to administer them” (<span class="emphasis">Messages of the First Presidency,</span> 5:286).

We heard it done effectively in that great welfare meeting this morning. May I add just a word.</p>

Some have come to their bishops seeking assistance to pay for house payments, car loans, and utilities.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/prepare-for-the-days-of-tribulation.p4" pid="cE3c1HzggECvRUHvWeh9JA" hash="fJVugg">Unfortunately, there has been fostered in the minds of some an expectation that when we experience hard times, when we have been unwise and extravagant with our resources and have lived beyond our means, we should look to either the Church or government to bail us out. Forgotten by some of our members is an underlying principle of the Church welfare plan that “no true Latter-day Saint will, while physically able, voluntarily shift from himself the burden of his own support” (Marion G. Romney, in Conference Report, Oct. 1973, p. 106).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/prepare-for-the-days-of-tribulation.p5" pid="aVwpuOwNjkGNY5M_ocoAtw" hash="lkT1cQ">One of the first principles revealed to father Adam when he was driven out of the Garden of Eden was this: “In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/3.19" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 3:19</a>). All we obtain in life of a material nature comes as a product of labor and the providence of God. Work alone produces life’s necessities.</p>

They are faced with the financial burden of providing for the three great necessities of life: food, clothing, and shelter. I am also sympathetic to the situation of widows and other sisters who rear families alone. By revelation, the Lord made provision for their care and support. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/83.1-2,4-6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 83:1–2, 4–6</a>.)</p>

We do not know when the crisis involving sickness or unemployment may affect our own circumstances. We do know that the Lord has decreed global calamities for the future and has warned and forewarned us to be prepared. For this reason the Brethren have repeatedly stressed a “back to basics” program for temporal and spiritual welfare.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/prepare-for-the-days-of-tribulation.p8" pid="WCJM7SsvgE2UPohIVMtJGw" hash="Sg4-PA">Today, I emphasize a most basic principle: home production and storage. Have you ever paused to realize what would happen to your community or nation if transportation were paralyzed or if we had a war or depression? How would you and your neighbors obtain food? How long would the corner grocery store—or supermarket—sustain the needs of the community?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/prepare-for-the-days-of-tribulation.p9" pid="wrXKF2Aoy0yC455qImkB0w" hash="xWjBCA">Shortly after World War II, I was called by the First Presidency to go to Europe to reestablish our missions and set up a program for the distribution of food and clothing to the Saints. Vivid in my memory are the people who got on trains each morning with all kinds of bric-a-brac in their arms to go out to the countryside to trade their possessions for food. At evening time, the train station was filled with people with arms full of vegetables and fruits, and a menagerie of squealing pigs and chickens. You never heard such a commotion. These people were, of course, willing to barter practically anything for that commodity which sustains life—food.</p>

We are too accustomed to going to stores and purchasing what we need. By producing some of our food we reduce, to a great extent, the impact of inflation on our money. More importantly, we learn how to produce our own food and involve all family members in a beneficial project. No more timely counsel, I feel, has been given by President Kimball than his repeated emphasis to grow our own gardens. Here is one sample of his emphasis over the past seven years:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/prepare-for-the-days-of-tribulation.p11" pid="N7LlOzgGQ06-HPdmRWI-sQ" hash="8JvL7A">“We encourage you to grow all the food that you feasibly can on your own property. Berry bushes, grapevines, fruit trees—plant them if your climate is right for their growth. Grow vegetables and eat them from your own yard.” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 1976, p. 124).</p>

Others have rationalized that they had no time or space. May I suggest you do what others have done. Get together with others and seek permission to use a vacant lot for a garden, or rent a plot of ground and grow your gardens. Some elders quorums have done this as a quorum, and all who have participated have reaped the benefits of a vegetable and fruit harvest and the blessings of cooperation and family involvement. Many families have dug up lawn space for gardens.</p>

The Lord wants us to be independent and self-reliant because these will be days of tribulation. He has warned and forewarned us of the eventuality.</p>

The Church has not told you what foods should be stored. This decision is left up to individual members. However, some excellent suggestions are available in the booklet produced by the Church entitled “Essentials of Home Production &amp; Storage” (stock no. PGWE1125; 35¢ each). There are also booklets available on gardening from BYU.</p>

Water, of course, is essential. Other basics could include honey or sugar, legumes, milk products or substitutes, and salt or its equivalent. The revelation to produce and store food may be as essential to our temporal welfare today as boarding the ark was to the people in the days of Noah.</p>

We wouldn’t get fat on it, but we would live; and if you think in terms of that kind of annual storage rather than a whole year’s supply of everything that you are accustomed to eat which, in most cases, is utterly impossible for the average family, I think we will come nearer to what President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., advised us way back in 1937.” (In Welfare Conference, 1 October 1966.)</p>

Let every head of every household aim to own his own home, free from mortgage. Let every man who has a garden spot, garden it; every man who owns a farm, farm it.” (President J.

Plan to build up your food supply just as you would a savings account. Save a little for storage each pay-check. Can or bottle fruit and vegetables from your gardens and orchards. Learn how to preserve food through drying and possibly freezing. Make your storage a part of your budget. Store seeds and have sufficient tools on hand to do the job. If you are saving and planning for a second car or a TV set or some item which merely adds to your comfort or pleasure, you may need to change your priorities. We urge you to do this prayerfully and <span class="emphasis">do it now.</span></p>

I have seen what the days of tribulation can do to people. I have seen hunger stalk the streets of Europe. I have witnessed the appalling, emaciated shadows of human figures.

Most had never seen these items before because of the wartime conditions. Nor can I forget the expectant and nursing mothers whose eyes watered with tears when we gave them each an orange. We saw the terrible physical and social side effects of hunger and malnutrition. One sister walked over a thousand miles with four small children, leaving her home in Poland. She lost all four to starvation and the freezing conditions. Yet she stood before us in her emaciated condition, her clothing shredded, and her feet wrapped in burlap, and bore testimony of how blessed she was.</p>

Nor will I ever forget the faith of the Dutch Saints who accepted our suggestion to grow potatoes to alleviate their own starving conditions, and then sent a portion of their first harvest to the German people who had been their bitter enemies. The following year they sent them the entire harvest. The annals of Church history have seldom recorded a more Christlike act of love and compassion.</p>

I bear witness to that inspired counsel from 1936 to the present day that the Saints lay up a year’s supply of food. When President Spencer W. Kimball persistently admonishes the members to plant gardens and fruit trees and produce our own food, he is likewise inspired of the Lord.</p>

For your own sake, for the love that should exist between you and your boys—however wayward they might be, … when you speak or talk to them, do it not in anger; do it not harshly, in a condemning spirit. Speak to them kindly; get down and weep with them, if necessary, and get them to shed tears with you if possible. Soften their hearts; get them to feel tenderly towards you.

The purpose of this school was to prepare selected members of the priesthood to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ to all the world.</p>

Whitney. Brigham Young was one of the early participants in this school, and he described a scene which frequently presented itself during meetings:</p>

When they assembled together in this room after breakfast, the first they did was to light their pipes, and, while smoking, talk about the great things of the kingdom, … and as soon as the pipe was out of their mouths a large chew of tobacco would then be taken. Often when the Prophet entered the room to give the school instructions he would find himself in a cloud of tobacco smoke. This, and the complaints of his wife at having to clean [the] floor, made the Prophet think upon the matter, and he inquired of the Lord relating to the conduct of the Elders in using tobacco.” (<span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> 12:158.)</p>

Opposition to the Church became very intense. It became so strong that the mission president asked that we discontinue all street meetings, and in some places tracting was also discontinued. The opposition started largely among the ministers, and it became very, very severe. They didn’t know anything about us to speak of. I remember tracting one day when a lovely lady came to the door. We were having a nice conversation and the name <span class="emphasis">Mormon</span> was mentioned by my companion. Her husband came to the door in a Navy uniform, and he said, “Oh, you can’t tell me anything about those old Mormons. I’ve been in the British Navy for twenty years. We sailed right into Salt Lake port, and they wouldn’t even let us land.” That was so typical of what they knew about us in those days.</p>

The hall was filled. My companion had planned to talk on the first principles, and I had studied hard in preparation for a talk on the Apostasy. There was a wonderful spirit in the meeting. My companion spoke first and gave an excellent inspirational message. I followed and talked with a freedom I had never before experienced in my life. When I sat down, I realized that I had not mentioned the Apostasy. I had talked about the Prophet Joseph Smith and had borne my witness of his divine mission and of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon. I couldn’t hold back the tears.</p>

We all received our handbooks at the same time. This was a great group of young men with a lot of musical talent.</p>

Among them were boys’ choruses. Each ward was expected to have a chorus, and ofttimes the bishop would invite the Scoutmaster to take the responsibility for getting the boys out to practice. So it was in our ward.</p>

Under her direction we started our practices. The song to be sung in the competition was assigned by the general board and was the same throughout the Church—“The Morning Breaks; the Shadows Flee,” by Parley P. Pratt (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> no. 269).</p>

Finally the time came when we would meet in competition with the ten other wards of the Franklin Stake. We were successful in winning in the stake, and then we were to meet the winners of the six other stakes in Cache Valley in the tabernacle in Logan.</p>

As our accompanist played “The Stars and Stripes Forever,” those twenty-four boys went up the aisle single file and formed in a half moon on the stage while I crouched down between a couple of benches to try to give them some leadership. Then they sang as I’d never heard them sing, and of course you can imagine that I’d not be telling this story had we not won first place in Logan.</p>

During the meeting one little twelve-year-old raised his hand and said very formally, “Mr. Scoutmaster, I would like to make a motion.” That was a new thing in a Scout meeting—or at least it was for me—but I said, “All right, what is it?”</p>

Many years later, after having been in Idaho and Washington, D.C., I happened to attend a Sunday School in the Whitney Ward. One of the boys was serving as bishop, another was a counselor, a third was ward clerk, and another was the visiting stake high councilor. Then we went to the adult class; there was another one as the teacher. One of them was serving as the Scoutmaster. We had a fine session together and could account for each one of the boys except two. No one seemed to know where they were or what they were doing.</p>

In those days we held general priesthood meetings in connection with stake conferences, and during the meeting I noticed way at the rear of the hall what appeared to be a familiar face. At the end of the meeting, one of the two boys we had lost track of came forward. We threw our arms around each other, and I said to him, “What are you doing way down here?”</p>

That means, in due time, every country, nationality, and people.

But during President Kimball’s administration as President of the Church, over two million people were added.</p>

We have a General Missionary Fund in the Church to which we ask all members to contribute. Those who have received bounteously from the Lord can afford to give generously to support this program. Most adult members could contribute some each month and, by doing so, help prosper the missionary efforts throughout the world.</p>

It’s a wonderful occasion to be with you. I’m grateful to see so many fathers here in the Tabernacle with their sons, and I feel assured that this is the case with our unseen audience in many locations throughout the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/preparing-yourselves-for-missionary-service.p2" pid="k5emggHiB0mACoP5cwij3w" hash="wA4Adg">Fathers, your greatest influence with your sons will be your example. If you want your boys to see what the gospel will do for them, let them see what it has done for you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/preparing-yourselves-for-missionary-service.p3" pid="cU7hhGRfGEyVW00UgjEVyA" hash="1mvXOA">I want to say a few words to you young men who are here tonight because you hold the priesthood. The Aaronic Priesthood is to prepare you to serve—to serve our Heavenly Father all the days of your life. Most of you within the sound of my voice are preparing for a mission. Let me suggest four ways that you young men can prepare now for your missions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/preparing-yourselves-for-missionary-service.p4" pid="7Mwh9rwmPkOqvLVH1PmDLw" hash="RleMnw">
        <span class="emphasis">First, prepare yourselves physically.</span> A two-year mission today requires good physical health. It requires that you keep your body clean. In your early teenage years, when temptations come to you to take things into your body which are unsuitable, have the courage to resist. Live the Word of Wisdom—no smoking, no drinking of any alcoholic beverages, and no drugs. Keep your body pure—a pure vessel for the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/preparing-yourselves-for-missionary-service.p5" pid="riArgx4__kGwesVJJ-bGDw" hash="YD5hAw">Stay morally clean. This means that you keep a clean mind. Your thoughts will determine your actions, and so they must be controlled. It’s difficult to control those thoughts if you submit yourself to temptation. So you will have to carefully select your reading material, the movies you see, and the other forms of entertainment in order to have good thoughts rather than unwholesome desires.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/preparing-yourselves-for-missionary-service.p6" pid="ng2F4XavFEi1NEUVGE4erQ" hash="n36Q4g">
        <span class="emphasis">Second, prepare yourselves mentally.</span> A mission requires a great deal of mental preparation. You must memorize missionary discussions, memorize scriptures, and ofttimes learn a new language. The discipline to do this is learned in your early years.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/preparing-yourselves-for-missionary-service.p7" pid="Bq549M3AbEawnRAXUMXkVQ" hash="yLdhuA">Establish now the daily practice of reading the scriptures ten to fifteen minutes each day. If you do so, by the time you reach the mission field, you will have read all four of the standard works. I urge you to read particularly the Book of Mormon so that you can testify of its truthfulness as the Lord has directed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/preparing-yourselves-for-missionary-service.p8" pid="su489yXLqEeZz-CpsJZQrw" hash="6gsTUQ">
        <span class="emphasis">Third, prepare yourselves socially.</span> A mission requires that you get along with others. You must get along with your companion, who is with you twenty-four hours a day. You must learn to meet people and be gracious and practice good manners. One of the greatest assets that a person has in life is the ability to make friends. When you make a friend of a person, you can teach him the gospel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/preparing-yourselves-for-missionary-service.p9" pid="f2uhx0kxoECpm6n_hoixiw" hash="SUTW3Q">
        <span class="emphasis">Fourth, prepare yourselves spiritually.</span> A spiritual person obeys all the Lord’s commandments. He prays to our Heavenly Father, and he gives service to others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/preparing-yourselves-for-missionary-service.p10" pid="ZdAU3KUvwU-2700-G0QBow" hash="qlPD7g">Let me talk about obedience. You’re learning now to keep all the commandments of the Lord. As you do so, you will have His Spirit to be with you. You’ll feel good about yourselves. You can’t <span class="emphasis">do</span> wrong and <span class="emphasis">feel</span> right. It’s impossible! One of the great lessons I learned on my first mission was the principle of total obedience.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/preparing-yourselves-for-missionary-service.p11" pid="DjrTByLgKkaSUHCfD9jivg" hash="if_TgQ">In 1923 I was serving a mission in Great Britain. At that time there was great opposition to the Church. It began with the ministers and then spread through the press. Many anti-Mormon articles appeared in the daily press. A number of anti-Mormon movies were shown, and derogatory plays were produced on the stage. The general theme was the same—that Mormon missionaries were in England to lure away British girls and make slaves of them on Utah farms. Today that seems fantastic, but in those days it was very real. In some places we even had to stop tracting because of such misunderstandings.</p>

At that time I was serving as the conference president, and my companion was the conference clerk. When this instruction arrived, we already had a meeting scheduled for the following Sunday night. So we reasoned that we would hold that meeting and then discontinue street meetings thereafter. That’s where we made our mistake!</p>

The crowd was large and unruly. In our efforts to preach to them, my companion and I stood back to back. He spoke in one direction, and I faced the other half of the crowd.</p>

The crowd became noisy, and those on the outside were not able to hear too well.</p>

He took me by the arm and said, “Young man, you come with me. You’re lucky to be alive in this crowd.” He led me several blocks and then ordered, “Now you get to your lodge and don’t come out anymore tonight.”</p>

I worried and then prayed and waited. I became so concerned about him that I decided to disguise my appearance by putting on an old American cap and taking off my topcoat.

Anyone who will read the Book of Mormon and put it to the divine test that Moroni proposes (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.3-5" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 10:3–5</a>) can be convinced that Jesus is the Christ. Once that conviction is gained, then comes the question “Will we choose to follow Him?” The devils believe that Jesus is the Christ, but they choose to follow Lucifer.

When this happens, we will get the harvest President Kimball envisions. It was the “born of God” Alma who as a missionary was so able to impart the word that many others were also born of God.

The Book of Mormon was meant for us. It was written for our day. Its scriptures are to be likened unto ourselves. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/19.23" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 19:23</a>.)</p>

Since this is a general priesthood meeting, I will speak of fathers and sons. But of course, this counsel also applies to all parents and their children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/worthy-fathers-worthy-sons.p3" pid="U5ZCEe0GPEOGK0uqVtJomw" hash="E8E2oA">The opening lines of the Book of Mormon read: “I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my father.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/1.1" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 1:1</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/worthy-fathers-worthy-sons.p4" pid="Gb1xmEE9YkidrEkd01KzUA" hash="8DrpLA">Good fathers teach their sons, and good sons listen and obey. Teaching is done by precept and example, and by word and deed. A good model is the best teacher. Therefore, a father’s first responsibility is to set the proper example.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/worthy-fathers-worthy-sons.p5" pid="ktFt93KekkSoFdJThbc8vg" hash="t5nLUg">Lehi, Nephi’s father, lived an exemplary life. He had a vision in which he “beheld a tree, whose fruit was desirable to make one happy.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.10" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 8:10</a>.) This tree represented the love of God. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11.25" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 11:25</a>.) Lehi partook of its fruit, which “filled [his] soul with exceedingly great joy.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.12" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 8:12</a>.) After he had a personal testimony of its goodness, he took the next step of inviting his family to also partake.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/worthy-fathers-worthy-sons.p6" pid="hBpTpCgIgkySwpUhK1JN5w" hash="tCT0rQ">Fathers, here is a divine pattern: As the leader of the family, Lehi first taught by example. He led out in righteousness—in conversion to Christ. Then he taught by word, saying, “Believe as I believe.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/worthy-fathers-worthy-sons.p7" pid="xPbu75vV7UKtd0WVt9jOJA" hash="ef4UMg">What then was Nephi’s responsibility after receiving this kind of direction from his father? The Book of Mormon states that Nephi, having heard all the words of his father concerning the things which he saw in vision, was desirous that he might “know of these things, by the power of the Holy Ghost, which is the gift of God unto all those who diligently seek him.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/10.17" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 10:17</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/worthy-fathers-worthy-sons.p8" pid="rXNG-StcFUOFjYFP0_kGfw" hash="dBn7tw">Nephi had listened to his father, had believed his father, but he wanted to know through the same source his father knew—revelation. Worthy sons are entitled to receive from their Heavenly Father confirmation concerning the direction their mortal father gives them. It takes revelation to perceive revelation. So Nephi diligently sought the Lord and received a revelation which reaffirmed the revelation his father had given to the family.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/worthy-fathers-worthy-sons.p9" pid="AN_IXAK4TkmHziTfLGZ3SA" hash="6YXWiQ">What did the righteous fathers of the Book of Mormon teach their sons? They taught them many things, but the overarching message was “the great plan of the Eternal God”—the Fall, rebirth, Atonement, Resurrection, Judgment, eternal life. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.9" class="scriptureRef">Alma 34:9</a>.) Enos said he knew his father was a just man, “for he taught me in his language, and also in the nurture and admonition of the Lord—and blessed be the name of my God for it.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.1" class="scriptureRef">Enos 1:1</a>.)</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/worthy-fathers-worthy-sons.p12" pid="5xq-aDEdoUiH3Rpft17kpg" hash="2TBqxg">Lehi taught his son Jacob about the sacrifice of the Messiah and the need for “a broken heart and a contrite spirit.” He told his son that there is “opposition in all things” and that men are “free to choose liberty and eternal life” through the Lord or “captivity and death” through the devil, who desires all men to “be miserable like unto himself.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.7,11,27" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:7, 11, 27</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/worthy-fathers-worthy-sons.p13" pid="kzrC2cAKrk-PXEVASOruzA" hash="0ua4Jw">Repetition is a key to learning. Our sons need to hear the truth repeated, especially because there is so much falsehood abroad. Devoted Book of Mormon fathers constantly reminded their sons of saving truths. “O remember, remember, my sons, the words which king Benjamin spake unto his people,” said Helaman. “Yea, remember that there is no other way nor means whereby man can be saved, only through the atoning blood of Jesus Christ.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.9" class="scriptureRef">Hel. 5:9</a>.) “My sons, remember, remember,” Helaman continued, “that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.12" class="scriptureRef">Hel. 5:12</a>.)</p>

(<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/1.6" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 1:6</a>.) Alma bore witness to his son Helaman saying, “I do know; and the knowledge which I have is of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/36.26" class="scriptureRef">Alma 36:26</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/worthy-fathers-worthy-sons.p15" pid="AER2faLn0km84fEseAU_2w" hash="jepb1Q">Great family legacies are kept alive in the Book of Mormon. Alma taught Helaman about how he had heard Helaman’s grandfather prophesy. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/36.17" class="scriptureRef">Alma 36:17</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/worthy-fathers-worthy-sons.p16" pid="wd6_yDsiGECDYvDptoRqyw" hash="KUUfig">King Benjamin caused that his three sons “should be taught in all the language of his fathers.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/1.2" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 1:2</a>.) They needed to understand and use the language of holy writ. If they didn’t know the right words, they wouldn’t know the plan. The Mulekites had no scriptures, and their language and faith became corrupted. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/omni/1.17" class="scriptureRef">Omni 1:17</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/worthy-fathers-worthy-sons.p17" pid="W-HvTOSJ9Um8DJIIs7NlSQ" hash="9KTsuw">In the Book of Mormon, loving fathers commended their sons when they deserved it. Alma complimented Shiblon, saying, “You have commenced in your youth to look to the Lord.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/38.2" class="scriptureRef">Alma 38:2</a>.) Mormon told his son Moroni, “I recommend thee unto God.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/9.22" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 9:22</a>.) Our sons need to be encouraged in their righteous endeavors.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/worthy-fathers-worthy-sons.p18" pid="CFZgmdacZUKKSvFJt5DFKw" hash="Xnemtg">If their sons strayed, stalwart Book of Mormon fathers still continued to teach them. Lehi exhorted two wayward sons with “all the feeling of a tender parent, that they would hearken to his words.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.37" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 8:37</a>.) He preached to them and bade them keep the commandments of God. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.37-38" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 8:37–38</a>.)</p>

This loving father said that it was no excuse that many others were also guilty. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/39.4" class="scriptureRef">Alma 39:4</a>.) Alma told Corianton frankly that his conduct made it so that some people would not believe Alma’s words. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/39.11" class="scriptureRef">Alma 39:11</a>.) Alma then taught him the principle that “wickedness never was happiness.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/41.10" class="scriptureRef">Alma 41:10</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/worthy-fathers-worthy-sons.p20" pid="plhJyrHxeUqiD2WNzYE35g" hash="pRK0og">Why did righteous fathers in the Book of Mormon go to so much trouble to teach their sons the word of God? King Benjamin said it was to fulfill the commandments of God. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/1.4" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 1:4</a>.) He further stated that were it not for their having the brass plates which contained the commandments, they would have “suffered in ignorance.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/1.3" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 1:3</a>.) Could the lack of teaching the scriptures in our homes be a source of our suffering in ignorance today?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/worthy-fathers-worthy-sons.p21" pid="URc9q0JJp0eiHNlO6IHctg" hash="nerS6Q">As the brass plates blessed Lehi and his descendants, so our scriptures should bless us. “And now, my sons,” said King Benjamin, “I would that ye should remember to search them diligently, that ye may profit thereby; and I would that ye should keep the commandments of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/1.7" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 1:7</a>.) In other words, first read them, then heed them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/worthy-fathers-worthy-sons.p22" pid="XN0h2aHNKkqZ92rpRTEQtQ" hash="vJFdqA">At what age do we begin teaching our sons these gospel truths? Alma taught his son Helaman while he was in his youth. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/36.3" class="scriptureRef">Alma 36:3</a>.) Our youth ought not to wait until the mission field to get a grasp of the scriptures and a closeness to the Lord. Lehi said that his son Jacob beheld the glory of the Lord in his youth. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.4" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:4</a>.) Imagine what would happen to missionary work if we sent out that kind of young men.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/worthy-fathers-worthy-sons.p23" pid="9-eEC3mD4EOHG53FkZpWag" hash="ZLVmqg">How often should fathers teach these truths to their sons? King Benjamin speaks of having the commandments “always before our eyes.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/1.5" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 1:5</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/worthy-fathers-worthy-sons.p24" pid="HghHGzhbuESecx98FM5p6g" hash="JA8bGg">Enos describes the beginning of a great spiritual experience that happened to him this way: “Behold, I went to hunt beasts in the forests; and the words which I had often heard my father speak concerning eternal life, and the joy of the saints, sunk deep into my heart” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.3" class="scriptureRef">Enos 1:3</a>.)

It should be done individually as well as in the family. It should be preached and discussed so our children will know the commandments. It should be done from their youth up—and often.</p>

I realize my dependence upon the Lord, and I also know that Jesus Christ is the head of this church and that through Him we can do all things that are needful.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/cleansing-the-inner-vessel.p2" pid="zELuSuPGmkSruyERxrjvSQ" hash="Yb_NtA">I commend those of you who are present here this morning, as well as you who are listening or watching these proceedings and those who will later take the opportunity to hear or read the messages of this conference.</p>

Surely the Lord is pleased with the consecrated time, love, and generous support of so many of His Saints throughout the world.</p>

Seldom have the efforts of so few resulted in the blessing of so many!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/cleansing-the-inner-vessel.p5" pid="qH7LMPsyzEy5Lf5NR1A5Vg" hash="9QKHlg">As I have sought direction from the Lord, I have had reaffirmed in my mind and heart the declaration of the Lord to “say nothing but repentance unto this generation.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6.9" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 6:9</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/11.9" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 11:9</a>.) This has been a theme of every latter-day prophet, along with their testimony that Jesus is the Christ and that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/cleansing-the-inner-vessel.p6" pid="4XNfI7pbvUSNp9Lt_8mU2w" hash="xLC4DQ">Repentance was the cry of our late and great prophet, Spencer W. Kimball. This theme permeated his talks and the pages of his writings, such as his marvelous book <span class="emphasis">The Miracle of Forgiveness.</span> And it must be our cry today, both to member and to nonmember alike—repent.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/cleansing-the-inner-vessel.p7" pid="ARdgbVFjuUG9eO7JSrjCJg" hash="KlnDXg">Watchmen—what of the night? We must respond by saying that all is not well in Zion. As Moroni counseled, we must cleanse the inner vessel (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/60.23" class="scriptureRef">Alma 60:23</a>), beginning first with ourselves, then with our families, and finally with the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/cleansing-the-inner-vessel.p8" pid="yPR0KovEME2sqXcFQIVg1w" hash="SV30rA">A prophet of God stated, “Ye shall clear away the bad according as the good shall grow … until the good shall overcome the bad.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5.66" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 5:66</a>.) It takes a Zion people to make a Zion society, and we must prepare for that.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/cleansing-the-inner-vessel.p9" pid="Oe5tS2vis0GXBI3Xj90xyg" hash="pdgyEA">During the past few years a number of resources have been set in place in the Church to help us. New editions of the scriptures have been published—are we taking advantage of them? More temples are located closer to our people—are we going to the house of the Lord more frequently? The consolidated meeting schedule was set up—are we taking advantage of the increased time with our families? A special home evening manual was provided—are we using it? A new hymnal has just been published—are we singing more songs of the heart? (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/25.12" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 25:12</a>.) And so the list goes on and on. We have received much help. We don’t need changed programs now as much as we need changed people!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/cleansing-the-inner-vessel.p10" pid="iYiYTijPiU6rLkCXb3ic6w" hash="xCQHEw">We remember our beloved President Kimball for many marvelous words of counsel, among which was his encouragement to “lengthen our stride.” We needed that direction, for the Book of Mormon warns us of the tactics of the adversary in the last days: “And others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal security, that they will say: All is well in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well—and thus the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.21" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 28:21</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/cleansing-the-inner-vessel.p11" pid="GlBB4v_VMUOMnVgAYd31nQ" hash="IPI87Q">There are many “awake” passages in the Book of Mormon, such as: “O that ye would awake; awake from a deep sleep, yea, even from the sleep of hell … awake … [and] put on the armor of righteousness. Shake off the chains with which ye are bound, and come forth out of obscurity, and arise from the dust.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/1.13,23" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 1:13, 23</a>.) As a people, it seems we can survive persecution easier and better than we can peace and prosperity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/cleansing-the-inner-vessel.p12" pid="ljQgTAnkm0K1nWVBvbMQSA" hash="dbKdLA">The plaguing sin of this generation is sexual immorality. This, the Prophet Joseph said, would be the source of more temptations, more buffetings, and more difficulties for the elders of Israel than any other. (See <span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> 8:55.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/cleansing-the-inner-vessel.p13" pid="vAMedAyDrUirbGWX28_gSg" hash="jf8hHA">President Joseph F. Smith said that sexual impurity would be one of the three dangers that would threaten the Church within—and so it does. (See <span class="emphasis">Gospel Doctrine,</span> pp. 312–13.) It permeates our society.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/cleansing-the-inner-vessel.p14" pid="UC-ZKYOoVUOqgOmszNXAaw" hash="75mXnA">In the category of sins, the Book of Mormon places unchastity next to murder. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/39.5" class="scriptureRef">Alma 39:5</a>.) As Alma states, “Now … I would that ye should repent and forsake your sins, and go no more after the lusts of your eyes, … for except ye do this ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/39.9" class="scriptureRef">Alma 39:9</a>.) If we are to cleanse the inner vessel, we must forsake immorality and be clean.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/cleansing-the-inner-vessel.p15" pid="tEzWVLxTEUyhmP-VVkbbUg" hash="2g3Isw">Unless we read the Book of Mormon and give heed to its teachings, the Lord has stated in section 84 of the Doctrine and Covenants that the whole Church is under condemnation: “And this condemnation resteth upon the children of Zion, even all.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.56" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:56</a>.) The Lord continues: “And they shall remain under this condemnation until they repent and remember the new covenant, even the Book of Mormon and the former commandments which I have given them, not only to say, but to do according to that which I have written.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.57" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:57</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/cleansing-the-inner-vessel.p16" pid="uVdOzQ-4lUWgfQPrkWJNXw" hash="HKWNtQ">Now we not only need to <span class="emphasis">say</span> more about the Book of Mormon, but we need to <span class="emphasis">do</span> more with it. Why? The Lord answers: “That they may bring forth fruit meet for their Father’s kingdom; otherwise there remaineth a scourge and judgment to be poured out upon the children of Zion.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.58" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:58</a>.) We have felt that scourge and judgment!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/cleansing-the-inner-vessel.p17" pid="Zag7vg8R0kCxOTxkfjjd8g" hash="vwwIWQ">The Prophet Joseph said that “the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than any other book.” (Book of Mormon, Introduction.) The Book of Mormon has not been, nor is it yet, the center of our personal study, family teaching, preaching, and missionary work. Of this we must repent. I do not know of a man living today who has been more true to the Book of Mormon than President Marion G. Romney. In a general conference address, he declared that the Book of Mormon was “the most effective piece of missionary literature we have.” He quoted the Doctrine and Covenants, which states that “the Book of Mormon and the holy scriptures are given of me for your instruction” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/33.16" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 33:16</a>) and that “the elders, priests and teachers of this church shall teach the principles of my gospel, which are in the Bible and the Book of Mormon.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.12" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 42:12</a>.) President Romney added, “It is of course obvious that unless we read, study, and learn the principles which are in the Book of Mormon, we, the elders, priests, and teachers of this church, cannot comply with this direction to teach them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/cleansing-the-inner-vessel.p18" pid="vfpV_tS8l0W__mib3uvVgQ" hash="fba0Bw">“But there is another reason why we should read it,” President Romney continued. “By doing so we will fill and refresh our minds with the constant flow of that ‘water’ which Jesus said would be in us—‘a well of water springing up into everlasting life.’ (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/4.14" class="scriptureRef">John 4:14</a>.) We must obtain a continuing supply of this water if we are to resist evil and retain the blessings of being born again. …</p>

I know of no better way to do this than by reading the Book of Mormon.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/cleansing-the-inner-vessel.p20" pid="XVelEuCaHUGUKG3gxZ35pw" hash="wOft8Q">And then he concluded: “And so, I counsel you, my beloved brothers and sisters and friends everywhere, to make reading in the Book of Mormon a few minutes each day a lifelong practice. “I feel certain that if, in our homes, parents will read from the Book of Mormon prayerfully and regularly, both by themselves and with their children, the spirit of that great book will come to permeate our homes and all who dwell therein. The spirit of reverence will increase; mutual respect and consideration for each other will grow. The spirit of contention will depart. Parents will counsel their children in greater love and wisdom. Children will be more responsive and submissive to that counsel. Righteousness will increase. Faith, hope, and charity—the pure love of Christ—will abound in our homes and lives, bringing in their wake peace, joy, and happiness.” (Marion G. Romney, in Conference Report, Apr. 1960, pp. 110–13.)</p>

It is always considered as a sin. We are not speaking of a wholesome view of self-worth, which is best established by a close relationship with God.

Remember well the Book of Mormon account of Helaman’s two thousand stripling warriors and how the teachings of their mothers gave them strength and faith. These marvelous mothers taught them to put on the whole armor of God, to place their trust in the Lord, and to doubt not. By so doing, not one of these young men was lost.

In your own family, encourage family home evenings and be an active participant. Encourage family prayer and be on your knees with your family in that sacred circle. Do your part to develop real family unity and solidarity. In such homes, there is no generation gap.</p>

We remember the experience of our beloved prophet President Spencer W. Kimball. As a fourteen-year-old boy he accepted the challenge of reading the Bible from cover to cover. Most of his reading was done by coal oil light in his attic bedroom. He read every night until he completed the 1,519 pages, which took him approximately a year; but he attained his goal.</p>

The Book of Mormon was referred to by the Prophet Joseph Smith as “the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion.” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 4:461.)</p>

It will fortify you against the evils of our day. It will bring a spirituality into your life that no other book will. It will be the most important book you will read in preparation for a mission and for life. A young man who knows and loves the Book of Mormon, who has read it several times, who has an abiding testimony of its truthfulness, and who applies its teachings will be able to stand against the wiles of the devil and will be a mighty tool in the hands of the Lord.</p>

Study it carefully and regard it as personal scripture to you—for that is what it is. A patriarchal blessing is the inspired and prophetic statement of your life’s mission together with blessings, cautions, and admonitions as the patriarch may be prompted to give. Young men, receive your patriarchal blessing under the influence of fasting and prayer, and then read it regularly that you may know God’s will for you.</p>

Scholarships can be deferred. Occupational goals can be postponed. Yes, even temple marriage should wait until after a young man has served an honorable full-time mission for the Lord.

Show your love and commitment to the Lord by responding to His call to serve. Know that the real purpose in going into the mission field is to bring souls unto Christ, to teach and baptize our Heavenly Father’s children so that you may rejoice with them in the kingdom of our Father.

The miracle of forgiveness is real, and true repentance is accepted of the Lord.

The gift I am thinking of is more important than any of the inventions that have come out of the industrial and technological revolutions. This is a gift of greater value to mankind than even the many wonderful advances we have seen in modern medicine. It is of greater worth to mankind than the development of flight or space travel. I speak of the gift of the Book of Mormon, given to mankind 156 years ago.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-book-of-mormon-keystone-of-our-religion.p2" pid="UWzRnObJ-0uvsrzAT7AiQQ" hash="lgLbsQ">This gift was prepared by the hand of the Lord over a period of more than a thousand years, then hidden up by Him so that it would be preserved in its purity for our generation. Perhaps there is nothing that testifies more clearly of the importance of this modern book of scripture than what the Lord Himself has said about it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-book-of-mormon-keystone-of-our-religion.p3" pid="0L75aaGeeUiS_BG1KV8f6w" hash="hBzp_A">By His own mouth He has borne witness (1) that it is true (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/17.6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 17:6</a>), (2) that it contains the truth and His words (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19.26" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 19:26</a>), (3) that it was translated by power from on high (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.8" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:8</a>), (4) that it contains the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.9" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:9</a>, <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.12" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 42:12</a>), (5) that it was given by inspiration and confirmed by the ministering of angels (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.10" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:10</a>), (6) that it gives evidence that the holy scriptures are true (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.11" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:11</a>), and (7) that those who receive it in faith shall receive eternal life (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.14" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:14</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-book-of-mormon-keystone-of-our-religion.p4" pid="GcMp7VguSU69JMrKYyYzEQ" hash="YQp8XQ">A second powerful testimony to the importance of the Book of Mormon is to note where the Lord placed its coming forth in the timetable of the unfolding Restoration. The only thing that preceded it was the First Vision. In that marvelous manifestation, the Prophet Joseph Smith learned the true nature of God and that God had a work for him to do. The coming forth of the Book of Mormon was the next thing to follow.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-book-of-mormon-keystone-of-our-religion.p5" pid="-gRxFJ8CL0GTZaQ9gqmEhQ" hash="dJKidw">Think of that in terms of what it implies. The coming forth of the Book of Mormon preceded the restoration of the priesthood. It was published just a few days before the Church was organized. The Saints were given the Book of Mormon to read before they were given the revelations outlining such great doctrines as the three degrees of glory, celestial marriage, or work for the dead. It came before priesthood quorums and Church organization. Doesn’t this tell us something about how the Lord views this sacred work?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-book-of-mormon-keystone-of-our-religion.p6" pid="XqbLHyh-nUqL2S02AUVYEQ" hash="6IhdYw">Once we realize how the Lord feels about this book, it should not surprise us that He also gives us solemn warnings about how we receive it. After indicating that those who receive the Book of Mormon with faith, working righteousness, will receive a crown of eternal glory (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.14" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:14</a>), the Lord follows with this warning: “But those who harden their hearts in unbelief, and reject it, it shall turn to their own condemnation” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.15" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:15</a>).</p>

Surely the Book of Mormon is a sacred thing, and yet many trifle with it, or in other words, take it lightly, treat it as though it is of little importance.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-book-of-mormon-keystone-of-our-religion.p8" pid="JbLPDzT7Z0Cr1vEPz-92mQ" hash="mqqvyA">In 1832, as some early missionaries returned from their fields of labor, the Lord reproved them for treating the Book of Mormon lightly. As a result of that attitude, he said, their minds had been darkened. Not only had treating this sacred book lightly brought a loss of light to themselves, it had also brought the whole Church under condemnation, even all the children of Zion. And then the Lord said, “And they shall remain under this condemnation until they repent and remember the new covenant, even the Book of Mormon” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.54-57" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:54–57</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-book-of-mormon-keystone-of-our-religion.p9" pid="aQKunO9K6kuliRtoHo7zcw" hash="BPIOLg">Has the fact that we have had the Book of Mormon with us for over a century and a half made it seem less significant to us today? Do we remember the new covenant, even the Book of Mormon? In the Bible we have the Old Testament and the New Testament. The word <span class="emphasis">testament</span> is the English rendering of a Greek word that can also be translated as <span class="emphasis">covenant.</span> Is this what the Lord meant when He called the Book of Mormon the “new covenant”? It is indeed another testament or witness of Jesus. This is one of the reasons why we have recently added the words “Another Testament of Jesus Christ” to the title of the Book of Mormon.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-book-of-mormon-keystone-of-our-religion.p10" pid="DTdTjvl6eU-pH2eL-NO-HA" hash="q6QP_A">If the early Saints were rebuked for treating the Book of Mormon lightly, are we under any less condemnation if we do the same? The Lord Himself bears testimony that it is of eternal significance. Can a small number of us bring the whole Church under condemnation because we trifle with sacred things? What will we say at the Judgment when we stand before Him and meet His probing gaze if we are among those described as forgetting the new covenant?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-book-of-mormon-keystone-of-our-religion.p11" pid="DpeE5JQk-kizeMi4golvVA" hash="VSNHIA">There are three great reasons why Latter-day Saints should make the study of the Book of Mormon a lifetime pursuit.</p>

This was the Prophet Joseph Smith’s statement. He testified that “the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion” (Introduction to the Book of Mormon). A keystone is the central stone in an arch. It holds all the other stones in place, and if removed, the arch crumbles.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-book-of-mormon-keystone-of-our-religion.p13" pid="7vyugTe-L0GY168qJDdE9Q" hash="cMHzZQ">There are three ways in which the Book of Mormon is the keystone of our religion. It is the keystone in our witness of Christ. It is the keystone of our doctrine. It is the keystone of testimony.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-book-of-mormon-keystone-of-our-religion.p14" pid="X87OFA07MUGTSJ-6xnTQ6g" hash="pAtVPA">The Book of Mormon is the keystone in our witness of Jesus Christ, who is Himself the cornerstone of everything we do. It bears witness of His reality with power and clarity. Unlike the Bible, which passed through generations of copyists, translators, and corrupt religionists who tampered with the text, the Book of Mormon came from writer to reader in just one inspired step of translation. Therefore, its testimony of the Master is clear, undiluted, and full of power. But it does even more. Much of the Christian world today rejects the divinity of the Savior. They question His miraculous birth, His perfect life, and the reality of His glorious resurrection. The Book of Mormon teaches in plain and unmistakable terms about the truth of all of those. It also provides the most complete explanation of the doctrine of the Atonement. Truly, this divinely inspired book is a keystone in bearing witness to the world that Jesus is the Christ (see title page of the Book of Mormon).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-book-of-mormon-keystone-of-our-religion.p15" pid="3F5YmnVQmUKkJyWawsixqg" hash="PsfJUA">The Book of Mormon is also the keystone of the doctrine of the Resurrection. As mentioned before, the Lord Himself has stated that the Book of Mormon contains the “fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.9" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:9</a>). That does not mean it contains every teaching, every doctrine ever revealed. Rather, it means that in the Book of Mormon we will find the fulness of those doctrines required for our salvation. And they are taught plainly and simply so that even children can learn the ways of salvation and exaltation. The Book of Mormon offers so much that broadens our understandings of the doctrines of salvation. Without it, much of what is taught in other scriptures would not be nearly so plain and precious.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-book-of-mormon-keystone-of-our-religion.p16" pid="he4UyLe190eq0L_Yq_pUqg" hash="Q1U5lw">Finally, the Book of Mormon is the keystone of testimony. Just as the arch crumbles if the keystone is removed, so does all the Church stand or fall with the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon. The enemies of the Church understand this clearly. This is why they go to such great lengths to try to disprove the Book of Mormon, for if it can be discredited, the Prophet Joseph Smith goes with it. So does our claim to priesthood keys, and revelation, and the restored Church. But in like manner, if the Book of Mormon be true—and millions have now testified that they have the witness of the Spirit that it is indeed true—then one must accept the claims of the Restoration and all that accompanies it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-book-of-mormon-keystone-of-our-religion.p17" pid="u0viJdLhskWb211GRtBN7g" hash="DZ7vBQ">Yes, my beloved brothers and sisters, the Book of Mormon is the keystone of our religion—the keystone of our testimony, the keystone of our doctrine, and the keystone in the witness of our Lord and Savior.</p>

The Nephites never had the book; neither did the Lamanites of ancient times. It was meant for us. Mormon wrote near the end of the Nephite civilization. Under the inspiration of God, who sees all things from the beginning, he abridged centuries of records, choosing the stories, speeches, and events that would be most helpful to us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-book-of-mormon-keystone-of-our-religion.p19" pid="TsolFUXDZ06-WLlbdeSe2w" hash="iv4qBw">Each of the major writers of the Book of Mormon testified that he wrote for future generations. Nephi said: “The Lord God promised unto me that these things which I write shall be kept and preserved, and handed down unto my seed, from generation to generation” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.21" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 25:21</a>). His brother Jacob, who succeeded him, wrote similar words: “For [Nephi] said that the history of his people should be engraven upon his other plates, and that I should preserve these plates and hand them down unto my seed, from generation to generation” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/1.3" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 1:3</a>). Enos and Jarom both indicated that they too were writing not for their own peoples but for future generations (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.15-16" class="scriptureRef">Enos 1:15–16</a>, <a href="/scriptures/bofm/jarom/1.2" class="scriptureRef">Jarom 1:2</a>).</p>

And Moroni, the last of the inspired writers, actually saw our day and time. “Behold,” he said, “the Lord hath shown unto me great and marvelous things concerning that which must shortly come, at that day when these things shall come forth among you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-book-of-mormon-keystone-of-our-religion.p21" pid="5b3PUlRKL0WShGEEETP9Kg" hash="yhOVpg">“Behold, I speak unto you as if ye were present, and yet ye are not.

We should constantly ask ourselves, “Why did the Lord inspire Mormon (or Moroni or Alma) to include that in his record? What lesson can I learn from that to help me live in this day and age?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-book-of-mormon-keystone-of-our-religion.p23" pid="nfAQhgNm8kunwb0IyelN3w" hash="vbmY7Q">And there is example after example of how that question will be answered. For example, in the Book of Mormon we find a pattern for preparing for the Second Coming. A major portion of the book centers on the few decades just prior to Christ’s coming to America. By careful study of that time period, we can determine why some were destroyed in the terrible judgments that preceded His coming and what brought others to stand at the temple in the land of Bountiful and thrust their hands into the wounds of His hands and feet.</p>

From the Book of Mormon we see the evils of secret combinations portrayed in graphic and chilling reality. In the Book of Mormon we find lessons for dealing with persecution and apostasy. We learn much about how to do missionary work. And more than anywhere else, we see in the Book of Mormon the dangers of materialism and setting our hearts on the things of the world. Can anyone doubt that this book was meant for us and that in it we find great power, great comfort, and great protection?</p>

He said, “I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 4:461). That is the third reason for studying the book. It helps us draw nearer to God. Is there not something deep in our hearts that longs to draw nearer to God, to be more like Him in our daily walk, to feel His presence with us constantly? If so, then the Book of Mormon will help us do so more than any other book.</p>

It is not just that the Book of Mormon bears testimony of Christ, though it indeed does that, too. But there is something more. There is a power in the book which will begin to flow into your lives the moment you begin a serious study of the book. You will find greater power to resist temptation. You will find the power to avoid deception. You will find the power to stay on the strait and narrow path. The scriptures are called “the words of life” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.85" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:85</a>), and nowhere is that more true than it is of the Book of Mormon. When you begin to hunger and thirst after those words, you will find life in greater and greater abundance.</p>

When I ponder what kind of men and boys we should be as priesthood holders, I cannot help but think of the Savior’s questions to the Nephite twelve when He asked, “Therefore, what manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.27" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 27:27</a>).</p>

He is a member of the Godhead. He is the Savior and Redeemer. He was perfect in every aspect of His life. There was no flaw nor failing in Him. Is it possible for us as priesthood holders to be even as He is? The answer is yes. Not only <span class="emphasis">can</span> we, but that is our charge, our responsibility. He would not give us that commandment if He did not mean for us to do it.</p>

This is important, for if we truly become partakers of the divine nature, we shall become like Him. Let us examine closely what Peter teaches us about this process. Here is what he said:</p>

I recall vividly how the spirit of missionary work came into my life. I was about thirteen years of age when my father received a call to go on a mission. It was during an epidemic in our little community of Whitney, Idaho. Parents were encouraged to go to sacrament meeting, but the children were to remain home to avoid contracting the disease.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/godly-characteristics-of-the-master.p11" pid="UKILXb6YSE6spTjr-KxfnA" hash="V7dlAA">Father and Mother went to sacrament meeting in a one-horse buggy. At the close of the meeting, the storekeeper opened the store just long enough for the farmers to get their mail, since the post office was in the store. There were no purchases, but in this way the farmers saved a trip to the post office on Monday. There was no rural postal delivery in those days.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/godly-characteristics-of-the-master.p12" pid="bOEUXLttP02zttBERGbYlw" hash="OQbRVA">As Father drove the horse homeward, Mother opened the mail, and, to their surprise, there was a letter from Box B in Salt Lake City—a call to go on a mission. No one asked if one were ready, willing, or able. The bishop was supposed to know, and the bishop was Grandfather George T. Benson, my father’s father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/godly-characteristics-of-the-master.p13" pid="fVpMQki7zkawydtKitQuBQ" hash="NzVhWQ">As Father and Mother drove into the yard, they were both crying—something we had never seen in our family. We gathered around the buggy—there were seven of us then—and asked them what was the matter.</p>

Then Mother said, “We’re proud to know that Father is considered worthy to go on a mission. We’re crying a bit because it means two years of separation. You know, your father and I have never been separated more than two nights at a time since our marriage—and that’s when Father was gone into the canyon to get logs, posts, and firewood.”</p>

Though at the time I did not fully comprehend the depths of my father’s commitment, I understand better now that his willing acceptance of this call was evidence of his great faith. Every holder of the priesthood, whether young or old, should strive to develop that kind of faith.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/godly-characteristics-of-the-master.p19" pid="ITXeMW82K0WRkfa3a8KrNQ" hash="8VhxRA">Peter goes on to say that we must add to our faith <span class="emphasis">virtue.</span> A priesthood holder is <span class="emphasis">virtuous.</span> Virtuous behavior implies that he has pure thoughts and clean actions. He will not lust in his heart, for to do so is to “deny the faith” and to lose the Spirit (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.23" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 42:23</a>)—and there is nothing more important in this work than the Spirit. You’ve heard me say that many times.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/godly-characteristics-of-the-master.p20" pid="gcZYAhiBckOQwP8pqEjqTg" hash="1vIH0g">He will not commit adultery “nor do anything like unto it” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:6</a>). This means fornication, homosexual behavior, self-abuse, child molestation, or any other sexual perversion. This means that a young man will honor young women and treat them with respect. He would never do anything that would deprive them of that which, in Mormon’s words, is “most dear and precious above all things, which is chastity and virtue” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/9.9" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 9:9</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/godly-characteristics-of-the-master.p21" pid="x_JNOmIGNUC2dPWVr8JCbA" hash="x1MOPw">Virtue is akin to holiness, an attribute of godliness. A priesthood holder should actively seek for that which is virtuous and lovely and not that which is debasing or sordid. Virtue will garnish his thoughts unceasingly (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.45" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:45</a>). How can any man indulge himself in the evils of pornography, profanity, or vulgarity and consider himself totally virtuous?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/godly-characteristics-of-the-master.p22" pid="UycpDZ5TaEiO9EuCHy_RSg" hash="8ReOmQ">Whenever a priesthood holder departs from the path of virtue in any form or expression, he loses the Spirit and comes under Satan’s power. He then receives the wages of him whom he has chosen to serve. As a result, sometimes the Church must take disciplinary action, for we cannot condone or pardon unvirtuous and unrepentant actions. All priesthood holders must be morally clean to be worthy to bear the authority of Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/godly-characteristics-of-the-master.p23" pid="ID7fH2Wu7kWBStXndNXveg" hash="L2W7nw">The next step Peter describes in the growth process is to add <span class="emphasis">knowledge</span> to our faith and virtue. The Lord has told us that “it is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/131.6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 131:6</a>). In another place God commanded, “Seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.118" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:118</a>). Every priesthood holder should make learning a lifetime pursuit. While any study of truth is of value, the truths of salvation are the most important truths any person can learn. The Lord’s question “For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/16.26" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 16:26</a>) can be applied to educational pursuits as well as the pursuit of worldly goods. The Lord might also have asked, “For what is a man profited, if he shall learn everything in the world and not learn how to be saved?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/godly-characteristics-of-the-master.p24" pid="Dc9pPun1gE6trLcZpeG5TA" hash="R8jIvw">We must balance our secular learning with spiritual learning. You young men should be as earnest in enrolling in seminary and learning the scriptures as you are in working toward high school graduation. Young adults enrolled in universities and colleges or other postsecondary training should avail themselves of the opportunity to take institute of religion courses or, if attending a Church school, should take at least one religion course every term. Joining our spiritual education to our secular learning will help us keep focused on the things that matter most in this life. Though I am speaking to you priesthood holders, the same admonition applies to the women of the Church as well as to the men.</p>

Reuben Clark, Jr., spoke of the desired balance in these words: “There is spiritual learning just as there is material learning, and the one without the other is not complete; yet, speaking for myself, if I could have only one sort of learning, that which I would take would be the learning of the spirit, because in the hereafter I shall have opportunity in the eternities which are to come to get the other, and without spiritual learning here my handicaps in the hereafter would be all but overwhelming” (in Conference Report, Apr. 1934, p. 94).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/godly-characteristics-of-the-master.p26" pid="9XZtOYEZaEuGngx2iLA9PQ" hash="Zlw3Fw">President Spencer W. Kimball said it this way: “Youth, beloved youth, can you see why we must let spiritual training take first place?—Why we must pray with faith, and perfect our own lives like the Savior’s? Can you see that the spiritual knowledge may be complemented with the secular in this life and on for eternities but that the secular without the foundation of the spiritual is but like the foam upon the milk, the fleeting shadow?</p>

One need not choose between the two but only as to the sequence, for there is opportunity for one to get both simultaneously; but can you see that the seminary courses should be given even preferential attention over the high school subjects; the institute over the college course; the study of the scriptures ahead of the study of man-written texts; the association with the Church more important than clubs, fraternities, and sororities; the payment of tithing more important than paying tuitions and fees?</p>

Father went on his mission, leaving Mother at home with seven children. (The eighth was born four months after he arrived in the field.) But there came into that home a spirit of missionary work that never left it. It was not without some sacrifice. Father had to sell our old dry farm in order to finance his mission. He had to move a married couple into part of our home to take care of the row crops, and he left his sons and wife the responsibility for the hay land, the pasture land, and a small herd of dairy cows.</p>

It is a source of great truth. It teaches us about the life and ministry of the Master. From its pages we learn of the hand of God in directing the affairs of His people from the very beginning of the earth’s history. It would be difficult to underestimate the impact the Bible has had on the history of the world. Its pages have blessed the lives of generations.</p>

Without additional revelation to guide them, men began to interpret the Bible differently. Numerous churches and creeds developed, each using the Bible as its authoritative source.</p>

That sacred and holy book has been of inestimable worth to the children of men. In fact, it was a passage from the Bible that inspired the Prophet Joseph Smith to go to a grove of trees near his home and kneel in prayer. What followed was the glorious vision that commenced the restoration of the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ to the earth. That vision also began the process of bringing forth new scripture to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Bible in bearing witness to a wicked world that Jesus is the Christ and that God lives and loves His children and is still intimately involved in their salvation and exaltation.</p>

I love all of these sacred volumes. This afternoon I would like to speak particularly about the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants. These two great books of latter-day scripture are bound together as revelations from Israel’s God for the purpose of gathering and preparing His people for the second coming of the Lord. As President John Taylor wrote, the bringing forth of these two sacred volumes “cost the best blood of the nineteenth century” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/135.6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 135:6</a>), namely the lives of the Prophet Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum.</p>

There shall be no false doctrines, no teaching of men that will deceive us. … If we will search these revelations then we will be fortified against errors and we will be made strong” (in Conference Report, Oct. 1931, p. 17).</p>

How would He do so? Note what the Lord Himself promised He would do to preserve His people. He said:</p>

We have seen the marvelous fulfillment of that prophecy in our generation. The Book of Mormon has come forth out of the earth, filled with truth, serving as the very “keystone of our religion” (see Introduction to the Book of Mormon). God has also sent down righteousness from heaven. The Father Himself appeared with His Son to the Prophet Joseph Smith. The angel Moroni, John the Baptist, Peter, James, and numerous other angels were directed by heaven to restore the necessary powers to the kingdom. Further, the Prophet Joseph Smith received revelation after revelation from the heavens during those first critical years of the Church’s growth. These revelations have been preserved for us in the Doctrine and Covenants.</p>

It is the keystone of our religion. It is the keystone of our doctrine. It is the keystone of our testimony. It is a keystone in the witness of Jesus Christ. It is a keystone in helping us avoid the deceptions of the evil one in these latter days. Satan rages in the hearts of men and has power over all of his dominions (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.35" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:35</a>). But the Book of Mormon has greater power—power to reveal false doctrine, power to help us overcome temptations, power to help us get closer to God than any other book (see Introduction to the Book of Mormon).</p>

I can remember, as if it were yesterday, growing up as a young boy in Whitney, Idaho. We were a farm family, and when we boys were out working in the field, I remember Father calling to us in a shrill voice from the barnyard: “Tie up your teams, boys, and come on in. The ward teachers are here.” Regardless of what we were doing, that was the signal to assemble in the sitting room to hear the ward teachers.</p>

We always knew they would come. I can’t remember one miss. And we would have a great visit. They would stand behind a chair and talk to the family. They would go around the circle and ask each child how he or she was doing and if we were doing our duty. Sometimes Mother and Father would prime us before the ward teachers came so we would have the right answers. But it was an important time for us as a family. They always had a message, and it was always a good one.</p>

Five of the signers were captured as traitors and tortured before they died. Twelve had their homes ransacked and burned. Two lost their sons in the Revolutionary War; another had two sons captured.

Three months later the Lord said again, “Women have claim on their husbands for their maintenance, until their husbands are taken” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/83.2" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 83:2</a>). This is the divine right of a wife and mother. While she cares for and nourishes her children at home, her husband earns the living for the family, which makes this nourishing possible.</p>

Sometimes we hear of husbands who, because of economic conditions, have lost their jobs and expect the wives to go out of the home and work, even though the husband is still capable of providing for his family. In these cases, we urge the husband to do all in his power to allow his wife to remain in the home caring for the children while he continues to provide for his family the best he can, even though the job he is able to secure may not be ideal and family budgeting may have to be tighter.</p>

But we know that sometimes the mother works outside of the home at the encouragement, or even insistence, of her husband. It is he who wants the items of convenience that the extra income can buy. Not only will the family suffer in such instances, brethren, but your own spiritual growth and progression will be hampered. I say to all of you, the Lord has charged men with the responsibility to provide for their families in such a way that the wife is allowed to fulfill her role as mother in the home.</p>

We sometimes hear accounts of men, even in the Church, who think that being head of the home somehow puts them in a superior role and allows them to dictate and make demands upon their family.</p>

That is the model we are to follow in our role of presiding in the home. We do not find the Savior leading the Church with a harsh or unkind hand. We do not find the Savior treating His Church with disrespect or neglect. We do not find the Savior using force or coercion to accomplish His purposes. Nowhere do we find the Savior doing anything but that which edifies, uplifts, comforts, and exalts the Church. Brethren, I say to you with all soberness, He is the model we must follow as we take the spiritual lead in our families.</p>

Do not be so concerned about his physical appearance and his bank account that you overlook his more important qualities. Of course, he should be attractive to you, and he should be able to financially provide for you. But, does he have a strong testimony? Does he live the principles of the gospel and magnify his priesthood? Is he active in his ward and stake? Does he love home and family, and will he be a faithful husband and a good father? <span class="emphasis">These </span>are qualities that really matter.</p>

Some of our sisters indicate that they do not want to consider marriage until <span class="emphasis">after </span>they have completed their degrees or pursued a career. This is not right. Certainly we want our single sisters to maximize their individual potential, to be well educated, and to do well at their present employment. You have much to contribute to society, to your community, and to your neighborhood. But we earnestly pray that our single sisters will desire honorable marriage in the temple to a worthy man and rear a righteous family, even though this may mean the sacrificing of degrees and careers. Our priorities are right when we realize there is no higher calling than to be an honorable wife and mother.</p>

This morning I would like to speak to the elderly in the Church and to their families and to those who minister to their needs.</p>

It has always been so, and upon them He has bestowed many of His greatest responsibilities. In various dispensations He has guided His people through prophets who were in their advancing years. He has needed the wisdom and experience of age, the inspired direction from those with long years of proven faithfulness to His gospel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/to-the-elderly-in-the-church.p7" pid="AJz596SJL0-poCXVXYjuUA" hash="Vic8EQ">The Lord blessed Sarah, in her old age, to bear Abraham a child. Perhaps King Benjamin’s greatest sermon was given when he was very elderly and nigh unto death. He was truly an instrument in the hands of the Lord as he was able to lead and establish peace among his people.</p>

How the Lord knows and loves His children who have given so much through their years of experience!</p>

We pray that you will feel the joy of a life well-spent and one filled with fond memories and even greater expectations through Christ’s atonement. We hope you will feel of the peace the Lord promised those who continue to strive to keep His commandments and follow His example. We hope your days are filled with things to do and ways in which you can render service to others who are not as fortunate as you. Older almost always means better, for your wealth of wisdom and experience can continue to expand and increase as you reach out to others.</p>

	<p pid="2ICr6pK1IEyTWPbcmAfwpw" hash="nlvxfw">May we suggest eight areas in which we can make the most of our senior years:</p>
	<ol class="number">
	  <li pid="ungfxQv0wkeA1K-TvD9MRQ" hash="iIoNrQ">
          <span class="label">1.</span>
          <p pid="L1uKN1vS4EuRcDkDn47xwQ" hash="beyZFw">Work in the temple and attend often. We who are older should use our energies not only to bless our predecessors, but to ensure that, insofar as possible, all of our posterity might receive the ordinances of exaltation in the temple. Work with your families; counsel with and pray for those who may yet be unwilling to prepare themselves.</p>
          <p pid="mJJyPQA0BUCy9GHQHSnOCQ" hash="cKQjtw">We urge all who can to attend the temple frequently and accept calls to serve in the temple when health and strength and distance will permit. We rely on you to help in temple service. With the increasing number of temples, we need more of our members to prepare themselves for this sweet service. Sister Benson and I are grateful that almost every week we can attend the temple together. What a blessing this has been in our lives!</p>
        </li>
	  <li pid="OTRtejhaM0-ccxQ-wqZT_A" hash="tsV8mA">
          <span class="label">2.</span>
          <p pid="53JvZIQMoUSOhcjjSWPv6A" hash="lXFFVQ">Collect and write family histories. We call on you to pursue vigorously the gathering and writing of personal and family histories. In so many instances, you alone have within you the history, the memory of loved ones, the dates and events. In some situations you are the family history. In few ways will your heritage be better preserved than by your collecting and writing your histories.</p>
        </li>
	  <li pid="7dsxTHw_Mk-IqPoiJA1TBQ" hash="ZpXpdA">
          <span class="label">3.</span>
          <p pid="61Jk9ldF8UmwuyKY8MYgGw" hash="e6JysA">Become involved in missionary service. We need increasing numbers of senior missionaries in missionary service. Where health and means make it possible, we call upon hundreds more of our couples to set their lives and affairs in order and to go on missions. How we need you in the mission field! You are able to perform missionary service in ways that our younger missionaries cannot.</p>
          <p pid="sGdmN39pp0ieYXho-n8YgA" hash="f_stSg">I’m grateful that two of my own widowed sisters were able to serve as missionary companions together in England. They were sixty-eight and seventy-three years of age when they were called, and they both had a marvelous experience.</p>
          <p pid="Qg42fU9aqUyX67HY_4vQSA" hash="pgp4tA">What an example and a blessing it is to a family’s posterity when grandparents serve missions. Most senior couples who go are strengthened and revitalized by missionary service. Through this holy avenue of service, many are sanctified and feel the joy of bringing others to the knowledge of the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
          <p pid="pmbNVAfLB0SVRrbx6pCQMQ" hash="y3n78A">Also, through the Family-to-Family Book of Mormon Program, send copies of the Book of Mormon on missions for you with your testimonies enclosed.</p>
        </li>
	  <li pid="IEIwLM8Id0WTFIBGn0ddtA" hash="aMwdog">
          <span class="label">4.</span>
          <p pid="O4CwZCE8i0CXwRFB-wgvBw" hash="_ZPdsg">Provide leadership by building family togetherness. We urge all senior members, when possible, to call their families together. Organize them into cohesive units. Give leadership to family gatherings. Establish family reunions where fellowship and family heritage can be felt and learned. Some of the sweetest memories I have are of our own family reunions and gatherings. Foster wonderful family traditions which will bind you together eternally. In doing so, we can create a bit of heaven right here on earth within individual families. After all, eternity will be but an extension of righteous family life.</p>
        </li>
	  <li pid="u2G5bX-0oU6SXaO4kkhHbg" hash="uM7QbA">
          <span class="label">5.</span>
          <p pid="HofCtlpFOUeQa3Itn8HI1Q" hash="QlZrsg">Accept and fulfill Church callings. We trust that all senior members who possibly can will accept callings in the Church and fulfill them with dignity. I am grateful to personally know brethren who are in their seventies and eighties who are serving as bishops and branch presidents. How we need the counsel and influence of you who have walked the pathway of life! We all need to hear of your successes and how you have risen above heartache, pain, or disappointment, having become stronger for experiencing them.</p>
          <p pid="Ck5EEY8EikaqFRSP1bY9iQ" hash="WFsodA">There are rich opportunities for you to serve in most of the organizations of the Church. You have the time and solid gospel foundation which enable you to render a great work. In so many ways you lead out in faithful service in the Church. We thank you for all that you have done and pray that the Lord will strengthen you to do more.</p>

          <span class="label">6.</span>
          <p pid="F355nHo5BUaqlS0gTcP4xg" hash="htn_AQ">Plan for your financial future. As you move through life toward retirement and the decades which follow, we invite all of our senior members to plan frugally for the years following full-time employment. Let us avoid unnecessary debt. We also advise caution in cosigning financial notes, even with family members, when retirement income might be jeopardized.</p>
          <p pid="74XqaeTzWU6KM1sTYKoJmA" hash="FB-sTQ">Be even more cautious in advancing years about “get-rich” schemes, mortgaging homes, or investing in uncertain ventures. Proceed cautiously so that the planning of a lifetime is not disrupted by one or a series of poor financial decisions. Plan your financial future early; then follow the plan.</p>
        </li>
	  <li pid="DeU900ckFUSg16kwjfdSKQ" hash="AV9s6w">
          <span class="label">7.</span>
          <p pid="7KyoA1wUB06WFJ3OPQaO6A" hash="6sxY7Q">Render Christlike service. Christlike service exalts. Knowing this, we call upon all senior members who are able to thrust in their sickles in service to others. This can be part of the sanctifying process. The Lord has promised that those who lose their lives serving others will find themselves. The Prophet Joseph Smith told us that we should “wear out our lives” in bringing to pass the Lord’s purposes (D&amp;C 123:13).</p>
          <p pid="nxcqjvnV4k2HgR9_0g3vSw" hash="9euhbQ">Peace and joy and blessings will follow those who render service to others. Yes, we commend Christlike service to all, but it is especially sweet in the lives of the elderly.</p>
        </li>

          <span class="label">8.</span>
          <p pid="SLgzT2F_fUyAO-gXXzcifg" hash="xJOYrA">Stay physically fit, healthy, and active. We are thrilled with the efforts being made by so many of the elderly to ensure good health in advancing years. We see many walking in the early mornings. We hear of others who use exercise equipment in their own homes. Some even enter marathons and do remarkably well. Still others have swimming programs to keep them fit. Until recently our own beloved General Authority emeritus, Joseph Anderson, now in his one hundredth year, would swim a mile every day. I am not quite up to that, but I do enjoy a vigorous walk each day, which refreshes me.</p>
          <p pid="d_t04aI4I0WjqN_R-OsPXw" hash="vdRZnQ">How we love to see our elderly remain vigorous and active! Through keeping active, both the mind and the body function better. One stake president reported that one of his members went waterskiing on his eightieth birthday.</p>

Sometimes there is for some of you a feeling of uselessness and aloneness which can be almost overwhelming. In so many instances, this need not be so. In addition to the eight suggestions just mentioned, here is a sampling of activities that have proved helpful to others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/to-the-elderly-in-the-church.p13" pid="M1l6f63QnkaNneHPU4OwRA" hash="4D9Dig">Some who are alone keep busy by quilting blankets for each new grandchild to be married or each new baby born into the family. Others write letters on birthdays or attend school and athletic events of grandchildren when they can. Some compile albums of pictures of each grandchild to give on birthdays. We know of one widowed great-grandmother who teaches piano to nearly thirty students. She has spoken to nearly five thousand youth in the last three years. One of them asked her, “Did you cross the plains with the pioneers?”</p>

So many find fulfillment helping in these ways.</p>

We promise those who will render this kind of service that, in some measure, you will be healed of the loss of loved ones or the dread of being alone. The way to feel better about your own situation is to improve someone else’s circumstances.</p>

Our hearts and prayers go out to you. Remember what father Lehi said in blessing his son Jacob, who had suffered at the hands of his older brothers Laman and Lemuel. He said, “Thou knowest the greatness of God; and he shall consecrate thine afflictions for thy gain.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.2" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:2</a>.) And so he will for you.</p>

We trust your prayers are being offered daily and even hourly, if needed. As the Book of Mormon teaches, “Live in thanksgiving daily, for the many mercies and blessings which [God] doth bestow upon you.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.38" class="scriptureRef">Alma 34:38</a>.)</p>

Let us remember the scriptural command that we must care for those of our own house lest we be found “worse than an infidel.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-tim/5.8" class="scriptureRef">1 Tim. 5:8</a>.) I am so grateful for my own dear family and for the loving care they have given their parents over so many years.</p>

We love and appreciate them and are concerned about their happiness and well-being. We treat them with courtesy and thoughtful consideration. We seek to understand their point of view. Certainly obedience to parents’ righteous desires and wishes is a part of honoring.</p>

Beyond this they almost always made countless sacrifices as they cared for and nurtured us through our infancy and childhood, provided us with the necessities of life, and nursed us through physical illnesses and the emotional stresses of growing up. In many instances, they provided us with the opportunity to receive an education, and, in a measure, they educated us. Much of what we know and do we learned from their example. May we ever be grateful to them and show that gratitude.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/to-the-elderly-in-the-church.p27" pid="UDYzKXM-RUOTet_9KQqyog" hash="uvMFMg">Even when parents become elderly, we ought to honor them by allowing them freedom of choice and the opportunity for independence as long as possible. Let us not take away from them choices which they can still make. Some parents are able to live and care for themselves well into their advancing years and would prefer to do so. When they can, let them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/to-the-elderly-in-the-church.p28" pid="o99RAmvIGUat6V3em0OmfQ" hash="M5Umkg">If they become less able to live independently, then family, Church, and community resources may be needed to help them. When the elderly become unable to care for themselves, even with supplemental aid, care can be provided in the home of a family member when possible. Church and community resources may also be needed in this situation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/to-the-elderly-in-the-church.p29" pid="4MJSTrbjtEGi-hjRDaMPSA" hash="_8NFRg">The role of the care-giver is vital. There is great need for support and help to be given to such a person. Usually this is an elderly spouse or a middle-aged daughter with children of her own to care for as well as caring for the elderly parent.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/to-the-elderly-in-the-church.p30" pid="3pPRpei6WkS0IldmzHI-iA" hash="zUin0g">We also hope that you would include the elderly in family activities when possible. What a joy it is for us to see lively, sweet grandchildren with a loving grandparent in the midst of them. Children love such occasions. They love to have their grandparents visit them and to have them over for dinner, for family home evenings, and on other special events. This provides opportunities for teaching ways to honor, love, respect, and care for those who are in their later years.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/to-the-elderly-in-the-church.p31" pid="YnivNWoPPUG8n4E9Og-YFA" hash="Jr7fZQ">Grandparents can have a profound influence on their grandchildren. Their time is generally not as encumbered and busy as the parents’, so books can be opened and read, stories can be told, and application of gospel principles taught. Children then obtain a perspective of life which not only is rewarding but can bring them security, peace, and strength. It is possible to send letters, tapes, and pictures, particularly where distances are great and it is not possible to see one another often. Those who are blessed with a closeness to grandparents and other elderly people have a rich companionship and association. There might be times when they can attend graduations, weddings, temple excursions, missionary farewells and homecomings, and other special events with family members.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/to-the-elderly-in-the-church.p32" pid="BIeQVOkEVUKHqEHepS8OQA" hash="rMqxWQ">We enjoy watching our children and grandchildren grow and achieve in special ways, as we share in many of their joys and rejoice in their victories. Happiness blesses our lives as our children strive and achieve in their own lives. In <a href="/scriptures/nt/3-jn/1.4" class="scriptureRef">3 Jn. 1:4</a> we read, “I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.” And knowing this can bring a renewal of love and courage to continue in our own struggles.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/to-the-elderly-in-the-church.p33" pid="dICflQDoCEuWTvfDytopAw" hash="U1IHUw">Finally, we would urge priesthood leaders of the elderly to be sensitive to the Spirit of our Father in Heaven in assessing and meeting the spiritual, physical, emotional, and financial needs of the elderly. We trust you will utilize your counselors, Melchizedek Priesthood quorum leaders, and Relief Society leaders, home teachers, and visiting teachers in this great responsibility, for we must fulfill these duties without reluctance or hesitation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/to-the-elderly-in-the-church.p34" pid="Z4AAFUZxbUeWqL4K0pzy3Q" hash="cs4o9Q">We hope that priesthood and auxiliary leaders will continue to give the elderly callings in which they can use their reservoirs of wisdom and counsel. We hope, where possible, that each can be a home teacher or visiting teacher. Even those who are somewhat confined to their beds and homes can sometimes assist in this watch-care through telephone calls, writing notes, or other special assignments.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/to-the-elderly-in-the-church.p35" pid="UWZxgb6Fc0Cu0GsepunODA" hash="YqW4Zw">A priesthood leader can do much to assist and encourage individuals and couples as they prepare to serve missions. The temple extraction and welfare programs are blessed greatly by those who are in their senior years and have opportunities to serve in this area.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/to-the-elderly-in-the-church.p36" pid="dJhb5q7Xyk66oXCTbAcjnA" hash="AT5r-w">We hope each of the elderly individuals and couples has sensitive and caring home teachers and visiting teachers assigned to them. Great comfort and peace can come to those who know they have someone to whom they can turn in time of emergency or need. It is important that tact, diplomacy, and sincerity be evident in assessing and addressing such needs.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/to-the-elderly-in-the-church.p37" pid="AAU7vaV-q0KzWSTdjuBCYQ" hash="jEyiMg">We hope you will involve the independent elderly in compassionate service assignments. Include them also in stake and ward social activities, especially single members and those with dependent spouses. So many times they are forgotten. Especially at the time of the death of a spouse, loving care can be given. This is a very tender time for most.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/to-the-elderly-in-the-church.p38" pid="1Bnkb3Z530Ot5tKiSdCYag" hash="Jj9SAQ">At times temporary relief is very much needed and appreciated by family members who provide constant physical and emotional care to those with special needs. It is important to help the family maintain its functions as a family with periodic freedom from the heavy responsibilities that long-term or terminal illness can impose. All need loving support and relief from the overwhelming duties of serious illness or problems.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/to-the-elderly-in-the-church.p39" pid="4Oe2zwTwY0a9-tMYMOI2-g" hash="PkHFtQ">Transportation is often a great concern to the elderly. We can assist by providing a way for them to attend their Sunday meetings, visit loved ones, shop, and go to the doctor or clinic.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/to-the-elderly-in-the-church.p40" pid="sufLUEMOK02xBO6exPyqqA" hash="_sZY2Q">Again, we should prayerfully seek inspiration and direction in caring for the elderly. There is always a great diversity of individuals and individual needs.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/to-the-elderly-in-the-church.p41" pid="sBvpL4eW2UiiqpkF3vKUFA" hash="FXDF-Q">God bless the elderly in the Church. I love you with all my heart. I am one of you.</p>

May these golden years be your very best years as you fully live and love and serve. And God bless those who minister to your needs—your family, your friends, and your fellow Church members and leaders.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/to-the-elderly-in-the-church.p43" pid="IWQOh00GDU-FYqPHfdiOmA" hash="ES1TPw">I leave you my testimony of the joy of living—of the joys of <span class="emphasis">full</span> gospel living and of going through the Refiner’s fire and the sanctification process that takes place. As the Apostle Paul so well said, “We know that all things work together for good to them that love God.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/8.28" class="scriptureRef">Rom. 8:28</a>.)</p>

The work is true, and in the words of our Lord and Savior, “Look unto me, and endure to the end, and ye shall live; for unto him that endureth to the end will I give eternal life” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/15.9" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 15:9</a>), to which I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
