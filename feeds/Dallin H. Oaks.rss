As I have studied this subject, my thoughts have been drawn to some lines I read at BYU some twenty years ago. The first of these lines you will think strange as an illustration of the subject of education in the Church. They were written by Thomas Hobbes, the seventeenth century English political philosopher, in his greatest work, <span class="emphasis">The Leviathan.</span></p>

I am grateful that my education exposed me to that thought and others like it, because my familiarity with these thoughts has helped me to understand the world and its peoples and its problems.</p>

Consequently, this semiannual conference is my first opportunity to speak to the general membership of the Church, to express acceptance of my calling to the Council of the Twelve.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/why-do-we-serve.p" pid="8iYR927H2E6OzfYBjgTErw" hash="TCbhkA">I am thrilled with this calling. Having been “called of God, by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands by those who are in authority” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.5" class="scriptureRef">A of F 1:5</a>), I have gladly forsaken my professional activities to spend the rest of my days in the service of the Lord. I will devote my whole heart, might, mind, and strength to the great trusts placed in me, especially to the responsibilities of a special witness of the name of Jesus Christ in all the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/why-do-we-serve.p" pid="usXQLR81A0SMLnmwvuH0yg" hash="ZXOgWA">Many men and women were called to Church service last April. Eight men were called as General Authorities. Six women were called to the presidencies of the Relief Society and Young Women. Over two hundred men were called to serve as bishops, and over seventeen hundred men and women were called as full-time missionaries. In that same month, tens of thousands of others were called as officers and teachers and other workers in the many Church organizations throughout the world. Those called in April joined millions of others already serving in similar capacities in the restored Church.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/why-do-we-serve.p" pid="dZ5J_iAsPUiMztAc7NPBFg" hash="_Xx9OQ">Service is an imperative for those who worship Jesus Christ. To followers who were vying for prominent positions in his kingdom, the Savior taught, “Whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/20.27" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 20:27</a>.) On a later occasion, he spoke of ministering to the needs of the hungry, the naked, the sick, and the imprisoned. He concluded that teaching with these words: “Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/25.40" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 25:40</a>.)</p>

In another section of the Doctrine and Covenants, he instructed us to be “anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of [our] own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.27" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 58:27</a>.) Holders of the Melchizedek Priesthood receive it upon a covenant to use its powers in the service of others. Indeed, service is a covenant obligation of all members of the Church of Jesus Christ.</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.17" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 2:17</a>.) If we love him, we should keep his commandments and feed his sheep. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/21.16-17" class="scriptureRef">John 21:16–17</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/why-do-we-serve.p" pid="ltLlf_7wZUGx1DJoW39o2Q" hash="kXrolw">When we think of service, we usually think of the acts of our hands. But the scriptures teach that the Lord looks to our thoughts as well as to our acts. One of God’s earliest commandments to Israel was that they should love him and “serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/deut/11.13" class="scriptureRef">Deut. 11:13</a>.) When the prophet Samuel was sent to Bethlehem to choose and anoint one of the sons of Jesse as a new king for Israel, the Lord told him to reject the first son, though he was a man of fine appearance. The Lord explained, “Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/1-sam/16.7" class="scriptureRef">1 Sam. 16:7</a>.)</p>

We also read in Proverbs: “All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the Lord weigheth the spirits.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/prov/16.2" class="scriptureRef">Prov. 16:2</a>.)</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/why-do-we-serve.p" pid="dDZUL30w3UyGXDGPk1-cnA" hash="lj4lYw">Numerous scriptures teach that our Heavenly Father knows our thoughts and the intents of our heart. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6.16" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 6:16</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/24.12" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 24:12</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/18.32" class="scriptureRef">Alma 18:32</a>.) The prophet Moroni taught that if our works are to be credited for good, they must be done for the right reasons. If a man “offereth a gift, or prayeth unto God, except he shall do it with real intent it profiteth him nothing.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/why-do-we-serve.p" pid="hIEa71TvgU-Ul6yNYDBf7w" hash="7Nov6g">“For behold, it is not counted unto him for righteousness.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.6-7" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 7:6–7</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/why-do-we-serve.p" pid="AZMKSMJE10ioXpWKNVZWIw" hash="6lNy8Q">Similarly, the prophet Alma taught that if we have hardened our hearts against the word of God, we will “not dare to look up to our God” at the final judgment because “all our works will condemn us; … and our thoughts will also condemn us.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/12.14" class="scriptureRef">Alma 12:14</a>.)</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/why-do-we-serve.p" pid="OcLEN2ULOkyOaqaul-TBcA" hash="-oOK0g">People serve one another for different reasons, and some reasons are better than others. Perhaps none of us serves in every capacity all the time for only a single reason. Since we are imperfect beings, most of us probably serve for a combination of reasons, and the combinations may be different from time to time as we grow spiritually. But we should all strive to serve for the reasons that are highest and best.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/why-do-we-serve.p" pid="D7dtDxryiUWmnTAFcOk4Fw" hash="5K1yig">What are some of the reasons for service? By way of illustration, and without pretending to be exhaustive, I will suggest six reasons. I will discuss these in ascending order from the lesser to the greater reasons for service.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/why-do-we-serve.p" pid="Jo-H_fLrrEGoQYwVI1xN9Q" hash="7hKUDQ">Some may serve for hope of earthly reward. Such a man or woman might serve in Church positions or in private acts of mercy in an effort to achieve prominence or cultivate contacts that would increase income or aid in acquiring wealth. Others might serve in order to obtain worldly honors, prominence, or power.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/why-do-we-serve.p" pid="9akTD-ZtCUWMOZ6qhQNdWQ" hash="LoRKfg">The scriptures have a word for gospel service “for the sake of riches and honor”; it is “priestcraft.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/1.16" class="scriptureRef">Alma 1:16</a>.) Nephi said, “Priestcrafts are that men preach and set themselves up for a light unto the world, that they may get gain and praise of the world; but they seek not the welfare of Zion.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.29" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 26:29</a>.). In these latter days, we are commanded to “seek to bring forth and establish the cause of Zion.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6.6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 6:6</a>.) Unfortunately, not all who accomplish works under that heading are really intending to build up Zion or strengthen the faith of the people of God. Other motives can be at work.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/why-do-we-serve.p" pid="dOUcznhVyk-nbCyQ6U9eIg" hash="qCDZbw">Service that is ostensibly unselfish but is really for the sake of riches or honor surely comes within the Savior’s condemnation of those who “outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within … are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/23.28" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 23:28</a>.) Such service earns no gospel reward.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/why-do-we-serve.p" pid="Pjs27uSv-EuMrEFo8qZiZw" hash="AfFMcw">Another reason for service—probably more worthy than the first, but still in the category of service in search of earthly reward—is that motivated by a personal desire to obtain good companionship. We surely have good associations in our Church service, but is that why we serve?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/why-do-we-serve.p" pid="o6MQVjVagk6FuuC28QYL4Q" hash="-a9Bmw">I once knew a person who was active in Church service until a socially prominent friend and fellow worker moved away. When the friend moved from the ward, this person ceased to serve. In this case, a Church worker was willing to serve only when the fellow workers were acceptable.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/why-do-we-serve.p" pid="ELVtgS19xkOyJv21iK4cpw" hash="zJVTUw">Persons who serve only to obtain good companionship are more selective in choosing their friends than the Master was in choosing his servants or associates. Jesus called most of his servants from those in humble circumstances. And he associated with sinners. He answered critics of such association by saying, “They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/5.31-32" class="scriptureRef">Luke 5:31–32</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/why-do-we-serve.p" pid="QnKGz3SqbUa9Qgzjk-_mtg" hash="FBztqg">The first section of the Doctrine and Covenants, which speaks of people in the last days, gives a description that seems to include those who serve for hope of earthly reward of one sort or another: “They seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own god, whose image is in the likeness of the world, and whose substance is that of an idol.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.16" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:16</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/why-do-we-serve.p" pid="l_nT_xnojUG9tH9Q8cdmbA" hash="FBL2iA">These first two reasons for service are selfish and self-centered and unworthy of Saints. As the Apostle Paul said, we that are strong enough to bear the infirmities of the weak should not do so “to please ourselves.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/15.1" class="scriptureRef">Rom. 15:1</a>.) Reasons aimed at earthly rewards are distinctly lesser in character and reward than the other reasons I will discuss.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/why-do-we-serve.p" pid="jJWWODftckyPbBsFypQ2lw" hash="T8mr3Q">Some may serve out of fear of punishment. The scriptures abound with descriptions of the miserable state of those who fail to follow the commandments of God. Thus, King Benjamin taught his people that the soul of the unrepentant transgressor would be filled with “a lively sense of his own guilt, which doth cause him to shrink from the presence of the Lord, and doth fill his breast with guilt, and pain, and anguish, which is like an unquenchable fire, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.38" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 2:38</a>.) Such descriptions surely offer sufficient incentive for keeping the commandment of service. But service out of fear of punishment is a lesser motive at best.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/why-do-we-serve.p" pid="m0Tam5q94EeXNKLAmTOlSA" hash="__JqYQ">Other persons may serve out of a sense of duty or out of loyalty to friends or family or traditions. These are those I would call the good soldiers, who instinctively do what they are asked without question and sometimes without giving much thought to the reasons for their service. Such persons fill the ranks of voluntary organizations everywhere, and they do much good. We have all benefited by the good works of such persons. Those who serve out of a sense of duty or loyalty to various wholesome causes are the good and honorable men and women of the earth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/why-do-we-serve.p" pid="Sk_vmx63R06-5zMwGLD2EA" hash="SPQcCQ">Service of the character I have just described is worthy of praise and will surely qualify for blessings, especially if it is done willingly and joyfully. As the Apostle Paul wrote in his second letter to the Corinthians:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/why-do-we-serve.p" pid="hkqoPzYHh0-YavbeK4EidA" hash="hameQw">“But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/why-do-we-serve.p" pid="-6TDfWcS_EmmxrCIZualOA" hash="ghDPLQ">One such higher reason for service is the hope of an eternal reward. This hope—the expectation of enjoying the fruits of our labors—is one of the most powerful sources of motivation. As a reason for service, it necessarily involves faith in God and in the fulfillment of his prophecies. The scriptures are rich in promises of eternal rewards. For example, in a revelation given through the Prophet Joseph Smith in June 1829, the Lord said: “If you keep my commandments and endure to the end you shall have eternal life, which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/14.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 14:7</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/why-do-we-serve.p" pid="Agzgc90-qkSIExlCB4w-1g" hash="tm26tg">The last motive I will discuss is, in my opinion, the highest reason of all. In its relationship to service, it is what the scriptures call “a more excellent way.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12.31" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 12:31</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/why-do-we-serve.p" pid="bW0bNOMP5E6dvrWzNh59gw" hash="wEb9-Q">“Charity is the pure love of Christ.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.47" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 7:47</a>.) The Book of Mormon teaches us that this virtue is “the greatest of all.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.46" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 7:46</a>.) The Apostle Paul affirmed and illustrated that truth in his great teaching about the reasons for service:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/why-do-we-serve.p" pid="TL2Fz3ozCUK1oHe_FJEdqA" hash="kuQ3vg">“Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. …</p>

The Savior applied that principle in the Sermon on the Mount, in which he commanded us to love our enemies, bless them that curse us, do good to them that hate us, and pray for them that despitefully use us and persecute us. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.44" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 5:44</a>.) He explained the purpose of that commandment as follows:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/why-do-we-serve.p" pid="Eg7wxvf69UqLg2e4rcHM9Q" hash="5QnbCg">“For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/why-do-we-serve.p" pid="FoBH2jm2i0GXDoVzgKB1RQ" hash="Jo20ew">This principle—that our service should be for the love of God and the love of fellowmen rather than for personal advantage or any other lesser motive—is admittedly a high standard. The Savior must have seen it so, since he joined his commandment for selfless and complete love directly with the ideal of perfection. The very next verse of the Sermon on the Mount contains this great commandment: “Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.48" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 5:48</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/why-do-we-serve.p" pid="2P2NXpbTCkS1fSgKC8bdjg" hash="hsMXKQ">This principle of service is reaffirmed in the fourth section of the Doctrine and Covenants:</p>

This is a holy day for all of Christianity. Countless Christians attend worship services on this day to partake of the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper, which many call communion. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/10.16" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 10:16</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/taking-upon-us-the-name-of-jesus-christ.p2" pid="qbqp7-Uu40iJSTNVGryd0w" hash="6L0LBQ">Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are commanded to partake of the sacrament each week. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.9,12" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:9, 12</a>.) In doing so, they witness unto God the Eternal Father, as stated in the prayer on the bread, that they are “willing to take upon them the name of thy Son, and always remember him and keep his commandments which he has given them.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.77" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:77</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/4.3" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 4:3</a>.) We should ponder these sacred covenants during the sacrament service.</p>

I will focus on the first of these solemn “witnesses” to God the Eternal Father: that we are willing to take upon us the name of his Son. What does this mean?</p>

Some of these meanings are obvious, and well within the understanding of our children. Others are only evident to those who have searched the scriptures and pondered the wonders of eternal life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/taking-upon-us-the-name-of-jesus-christ.p5" pid="LzNQGs3ttUa2XQs1ig8_oQ" hash="q3Zqag">One of the obvious meanings renews a promise we made when we were baptized. Following the scriptural pattern, persons who are baptized witness before the Church that they have truly repented of all their sins, and are willing to take upon them the name of Jesus Christ, having a determination to serve him to the end.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.37" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:37</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.13" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 31:13</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/6.3" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 6:3</a>.) When we partake of the sacrament, we renew this covenant and all the other covenants we made in the waters of baptism. (See Joseph Fielding Smith, <span class="emphasis">Doctrines of Salvation,</span> comp. Bruce R. McConkie, 3 vols., Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1954–56, 2:341, 346.)</p>

By his commandment, this church bears his name. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/115.4" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 115:4</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.7-8" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 27:7–8</a>.) Every member, young and old, is a member of the “household of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/2.19" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 2:19</a>.) As true believers in Christ, as Christians, we have gladly taken his name upon us. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/46.15" class="scriptureRef">Alma 46:15</a>.) As King Benjamin taught his people, “Because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters; for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.7" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 5:7</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.14" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:14</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/36.23-26" class="scriptureRef">Alma 36:23–26</a>.)</p>

Each of us has many opportunities to proclaim our belief to friends and neighbors, fellow workers, and casual acquaintances. As the Apostle Peter taught the Saints of his day, we should “sanctify the Lord God in [our] hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh [us] a reason of the hope that is in [us].” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-pet/3.15" class="scriptureRef">1 Pet. 3:15</a>.) In this, we keep the modern commandment: “Take upon you the name of Christ, and speak the truth in soberness.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/18.21" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 18:21</a>.)</p>

Many scriptural references to the name of the Lord seem to be references to the work of his kingdom. Thus, when Peter and the other Apostles were beaten, they rejoiced “that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/5.41" class="scriptureRef">Acts 5:41</a>.) Paul wrote certain members who had ministered to the Saints that the Lord would not forget the labor of love they had “shewed toward his name.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/6.10" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 6:10</a>.) According to this meaning, by witnessing our willingness to take upon us the name of Jesus Christ, we signify our willingness to do the work of his kingdom.</p>

We witness that we are <span class="emphasis">willing</span> to do so. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.77" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:77</a>.) The fact that we only witness to our willingness suggests that something else must happen before we actually take that sacred name upon us in the most important sense.</p>

The scriptures suggest two sacred possibilities, one concerning the authority of God, especially as exercised in the temples, and the other—closely related—concerning exaltation in the celestial kingdom.</p>

The Lord’s Prayer begins with the words, “Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed by thy name.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/6.9" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 6:9</a>.) From Sinai came the commandment, “Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/20.7" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 20:7</a>, <a href="/scriptures/ot/deut/5.11" class="scriptureRef">Deut. 5:11</a>.) Latter-day revelation equates this with using the name of God without authority. “Let all men beware how they take my name in their lips,” the Lord declares in a modern revelation, for “many there be who … use the name of the Lord, and use it in vain, having not authority.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/63.61-62" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 63:61–62</a>.)</p>

This was surely the meaning conveyed when the seventy reported to Jesus that “even the devils are subject unto us through thy name.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/10.17" class="scriptureRef">Luke 10:17</a>.) The Doctrine and Covenants employs this same meaning when it describes the Twelve Apostles of this dispensation as “they who shall desire to take upon them my name with full purpose of heart.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/18.27" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 18:27</a>.) The Twelve are later designated as “special witnesses of the name of Christ in all the world,” and as those who “officiate in the name of the Lord, under the direction of the Presidency of the Church.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.23,33" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 107:23, 33</a>.)</p>

Most of these references have to do with the temple.</p>

The scriptures speak of the Lord’s putting his name in a temple because he gives authority for his name to be used in the sacred ordinances of that house. That is the meaning of the Prophet’s reference to the Lord’s putting his name upon his people in that holy house. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/109.26" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 109:26</a>.)</p>

Some interpret mortality solely in terms of worldly accomplishments and possessions. In contrast, we who have a testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ should interpret our experiences in terms of our knowledge of the purpose of life, the mission of our Savior, and the eternal destiny of the children of God.</p>

A scientist may be more spiritual than a theologian; a teacher may be more spiritual than an officer. Spirituality is determined by personal outlook and priorities. It is evident in our words and actions. Elder John Taylor showed his spirituality in these words, uttered as he reported on his mission to Europe in 1852:</p>

No. Who cares anything about it? What of it, if we should happen to drop by the way? … These things don’t trouble me, but I have felt to rejoice all the day long, that God has revealed the principle of eternal life, that I am put in possession of that truth, and that I am counted worthy to engage in the work of the Lord.” (<span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> 1:17.)</p>

The firstborn, Esau, “despised his birthright.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/25.34" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 25:34</a>.) Jacob, the second twin, desired it. Jacob valued the spiritual, while Esau sought the things of this world. When he was hungry, Esau sold his birthright for a mess of pottage. “Behold,” he explained, “I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/25.32" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 25:32</a>.) Many Esaus have given up something of eternal value in order to satisfy a momentary hunger for the things of the world.</p>

During a tragic afternoon on Calvary, a handful of soldiers waited at the foot of a cross. The most important event in all eternity was taking place on the cross above their heads. Oblivious to that fact, they occupied themselves casting lots to divide the earthly property of the dying Son of God. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/27.35" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 27:35</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/23.34" class="scriptureRef">Luke 23:34</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/19.24" class="scriptureRef">John 19:24</a>.) Their example reminds each of us that we should not be casting our lots for the things of the world while the things of eternity, including our families and the work of the Lord, suffer for our attention.</p>

In a BYU devotional several years ago, Elder Loren C. Dunn described how his father, a busy stake president in Tooele, gave his two young sons the responsibility of raising cows on the family farm. He gave the boys large latitude in what they could do, and they made some mistakes. These were observed by an alert neighbor, who complained to their father about what the young cow-raisers were doing. “Jim, you don’t understand,” President Dunn replied. “You see, I’m raising boys, not cows.” (“Our Spiritual Heritage,” in <span class="emphasis">Brigham Young University 1981–82 Fireside and Devotional Speeches, </span> Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 1982, p. 138.) What a marvelous insight! What an example for parents who are inclined to view and evaluate their children’s performance solely in temporal terms.</p>

The Spanish conquerors took irreplaceable objects of art from the craftsmen of the New World and melted them down into gold bullion. The enemies of the young prophet, Joseph Smith, hounded him to get possession of the golden plates from which he was to translate the Book of Mormon. They sought the golden plates to get money, not a message. The temporal value of the plates had a price; their spiritual value was priceless.</p>

Judged in terms of the values and aspirations of the world, some pioneer enterprises were failures. The iron mission did not succeed in making significant quantities of iron. The cotton mission did not give the Utah Territory self-sufficiency in cotton production. Efforts to manufacture sugar did not achieve material success for forty years. The Perpetual Immigration Fund did not perpetuate itself because many immigrants were unable to pay their debt to it.</p>

But when the men of Zion’s Camp approached their intended destination, the Prophet Joseph Smith disbanded them. According to its ostensible purpose, the expedition was a failure. But most of the men who were to lead the Church for the next half-century, including those who would take the Saints across the plains and colonize the Intermountain West, came to know the Prophet Joseph and received their formative leadership training in the march of Zion’s Camp.

Satan taught Cain that a man could get worldly wealth by committing some evil against its owner (see JST, Gen. 5:16; <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.31" class="scriptureRef">Moses 5:31</a>).</p>

Seeing this, the Lord asked Cain, “Where is Abel thy brother?” Cain first attempted to cover his sin with a lie: “I know not.” Then he added a rationalization: “Am I my brother’s keeper?” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/4.9" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 4:9</a>; <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.34" class="scriptureRef">Moses 5:34</a>).</p>

They covet property and then sin to obtain it. The sin may be murder, robbery, or theft. It may be fraud or deception. It may even be some clever but legal manipulation of facts or influence to take unfair advantage of another. Always the excuse is the same: “Am I my brother’s keeper?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/brothers-keeper.p8" pid="IvG3Za5ehEi4IUY0R8NVKQ" hash="0Zop8g">Those who follow the example of Cain fulfill a Book of Mormon prophecy. Seeing our day, Nephi prophesied that many would say, “Lie a little, take the advantage of one because of his words, dig a pit for thy neighbor; there is no harm in this” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.8" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 28:8</a>).</p>

Lee said, “The standard … in the Church must be visibly higher than the standard … in the world” (<span class="emphasis">Ye Are the Light of the World,</span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1974, p. 13).

But the inadequacies of the laws of man provide no license for transgression under the laws of God. Though their method of thievery may be immune from correction in this life, sophisticated thieves in white shirts and ties will ultimately be seen and punished for what they are. He who presides over that Eternal Tribunal knows our secret acts, and he is “a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/4.12" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 4:12</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/33.1" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 33:1</a>).</p>

What follows is more challenging. And it should be. We cannot expect to be comfortable if we measure our conduct against the Savior’s command, “I would that ye should be perfect even as I” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.48" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 12:48</a>). To follow in the footsteps of the only perfect person who ever lived, we must expect to stretch our souls.</p>

An idealistic young professional wrote Church headquarters about the plight of migrant farm workers. He had observed treatment that was probably illegal and certainly unchristian. When I read his letter, I thought of the positive example of Jesse Knight, the great benefactor of Brigham Young Academy. At a time when most mine owners exploited their workers, this Christian employer paid his miners something extra so they could earn their living in six days’ labor and rest on the Sabbath. He did not require them to patronize a company store. He built his workers a building for recreation, worship, and schooling. And Brother Knight would not permit the superintendent to question his workers about their religion or politics (see Jesse William Knight, <span class="emphasis">The Jesse Knight Family,</span> Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press, 1940, pp. 43–44; and Gary Fuller Reese, “Uncle Jesse,” master’s thesis, Brigham Young University, 1961, pp. 26–28).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/brothers-keeper.p22" pid="EEJZ6Zn-H0aa0Oc1OxtNGQ" hash="fD823A">Of course, we understand that what an employer can pay his employees is limited by what his business can obtain for its products or services in a competitive marketplace. Contracts also impose limits on legitimate economic expectations.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/brothers-keeper.p23" pid="HwnHdFXVQ0-EPtx9dCI7iA" hash="1OnG6g">Christian standards should also apply to those who earn a living by selling or advertising products in the marketplace.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/brothers-keeper.p24" pid="sJuNkgHytkC085ZShnQoTg" hash="lm0xBQ">The marketplace for products and services has many potential buyers who are vulnerable because they are poorly informed or excessively trusting. For example, a friend told me of a young student couple who didn’t have enough money for rent, groceries, and tuition but were persuaded to sign up for an expensive self-improvement course. Can a seller ever justify obtaining personal profit by persuading someone to assume a financial burden he cannot wisely bear in order to acquire something he does not really need? The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that Latter-day Saints should deal justly with their neighbors and mercifully with the poor (see <span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 5:401).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/brothers-keeper.p25" pid="rorYt0i2p029tC-WtaI8mg" hash="YuFi3A">To cite another kind of example, an owner who keeps his business open on Sunday prevents his employees from attending worship services and being with their families on the Sabbath. Modern-day prophets have encouraged us not to shop on Sunday (see, for example, Spencer W. Kimball, <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1974, p. 6). Those of us who shop on the Sabbath cannot escape responsibility for encouraging businesses to remain open on that day. Essential services must be provided, but most Sabbath transactions could be avoided if merchants and customers were determined to avoid doing business on the Lord’s day.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/brothers-keeper.p26" pid="ImzBgXL_fUq09PaWliI34g" hash="-zW1Aw">Last year the <span class="emphasis">Deseret News</span> carried an article about a Salt Lake City pharmacist who stopped selling cigarettes in his drugstore. He explained, “It’s just incompatible for a profession dedicated to saving people’s lives to sell a product that does nothing but kill” (20 Dec. 1985, p. B1). That merchant was more concerned about his customers’ welfare than his personal profits.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/brothers-keeper.p27" pid="LfxZYeqTUUK5QAziSelyhA" hash="wR0svQ">Sister Oaks called my attention to a similar example in the world of advertising. The magazine <span class="emphasis">Women’s Sports and Fitness</span> does not accept cigarette ads, thus foregoing much-needed revenue. A woman columnist and physician, Dr. Joan Ullyot, praised this policy and contrasted it to the practice of another organization:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/brothers-keeper.p28" pid="jkSZKTBJ-0C5t__5opIYzA" hash="xC6FsA">“I am dismayed that a prominent women’s sport, tennis, continues to take support from a cigarette company. Surely the top women in this sport, none of whom smoke, have the [courage] to say no to this hypocrisy and stop lending their names and prestige to sanction and glamorize a lethal product. Any role model in sport who accepts support or sponsorship from a company whose products destroy health and fitness should take a hard look at what she is, by association, endorsing” (<span class="emphasis">Women’s Sports and Fitness,</span> Sept. 1986, p. 12).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/brothers-keeper.p29" pid="Lhbiofx-YUWhGk0DNHilsQ" hash="1PuGgw">Wouldn’t it be wonderful if this same attitude of looking after the interests of others governed Latter-day Saints who are making a profit from the sale or promotion of alcoholic beverages? Consider the terrible effects of alcohol. Alcohol-related accidents are the leading cause of death of those under twenty-five. The physical, social, and financial effects of alcohol ruin marriages and family life. By dulling inhibitions, alcohol leads to untold numbers of crimes and moral transgressions. Alcohol is the number one addictive drug in our day.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/brothers-keeper.p30" pid="fAO4vJQhm0a-jllWTULmrw" hash="p7IFDA">The consumption of alcohol is increasing among youth. Targeting young audiences, advertisers portray beer and wine as joyful, socially desirable, and harmless. Producers are promoting new types of alcoholic beverages as competitors in the huge soft-drink market. Grocery and convenience stores and gas stations stock alcoholic beverages side by side with soda pop. Can Christians who are involved in this commerce be indifferent to the physical and moral effects of the alcohol from which they are making their profits?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/brothers-keeper.p31" pid="qPrblNbzAEmJqxMLmnyK5Q" hash="Wo_yrw">Other examples could be given, but these few are sufficient to illustrate the principle that the Golden Rule applies to our earning activities. We <span class="emphasis">are </span>our brother’s keeper, even in the marketplace.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/brothers-keeper.p32" pid="cS9JtWnsWkWfs0dM0cbkFg" hash="o3j5ww">I am aware that this is a high standard which cannot be met overnight. But it is important to recognize our responsibility and begin to work toward it. And we should do so joyfully. The gospel is the good news. Commandments lead to blessings. The Prophet Joseph Smith told our first missionaries that when preaching we should “warn in compassion.” We “have no right … to scare mankind to repentance,” he said. We should preach the gospel as “glad tidings of great joy unto all people” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 1:280).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/brothers-keeper.p33" pid="R74tlDtMDUW6M2F1_Uij5A" hash="T5fQEA">We should also remember that the principle that the Golden Rule governs our earning activities is difficult to apply in practice. We should not consider employees responsible for policies they regret but cannot control. A decision that is made by the owner of a market should not inflict feelings of guilt on a conscientious but powerless Christian who runs the checkout stand. Similarly, a part-owner does not have freedom to impose his standards on business policies if he has partners who do not share his moral concerns. An incorporated business may be controlled by stockholders who have no concern for the destructive human effects of a profitable product or policy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/brothers-keeper.p34" pid="BGkt_ssBtE--8VvEtUeG7A" hash="HwKixg">We live in a complex society, where even the simplest principle can be exquisitely difficult to apply. I admire investors who are determined not to obtain income or investment profits from transactions that add to the sum total of sin and misery in the world. But they will have difficulty finding investments that meet this high standard. Good things are often packaged with bad, so decisions usually involve balancing. In a world of corporate diversification, we are likely to find that a business dealing in beverages sells milk in one division and alcohol in another. Just when we think that our investments are entirely unspotted from the world, we may find that our life insurance is partially funded by investments we wish to avoid. Or our savings may be deposited in a bank that is lending to ventures we could not approve. Such complexities make it difficult to prescribe firm rules.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/brothers-keeper.p35" pid="FcDNzCUuokKRMmlPBsnC4g" hash="XW8x1Q">We must rely on teaching correct principles, which each member should personally apply to govern his or her own circumstances. To that end, each of us should give thoughtful and prayerful consideration to whether we are looking after the well-being of our neighbors in the way we earn our daily bread.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/brothers-keeper.p36" pid="PEJxc0tG40SfYp51Kipe9A" hash="SBsjkA">The motive of Cain is at the headwaters of wickedness. Cain’s sin was murder, but his motive was personal gain. That motive has produced all manner of wickedness, including murder, thievery, and fraud. That motive is also at work in the legal but immoral practices of those who get gain by preying on the weaknesses or ignorance of their neighbors. Always such activities involve Cain’s ancient rationalization: “Am I my brother’s keeper?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/brothers-keeper.p37" pid="-bQ4smu240CW8bEHzfQs1w" hash="0AvOZw">In contrast, the Savior taught us to “love [our] enemies, bless them that curse [us], do good to them that hate [us], and pray for them who despitefully use [us] and persecute [us]” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.44" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 12:44</a>). When we have that duty toward our enemies, we cannot allow ourselves to do less for our partners, our customers, our employees, and others with whom we deal in the marketplace.</p>

Our efforts and influence would affect millions. Examples improve society more than sermons. Most people would rather see a sermon than hear one.</p>

Fourth Nephi records: “Surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1.16" class="scriptureRef">4 Ne. 1:16</a>). We should be striving to regain that condition. As modern revelation declares: “Zion must increase in beauty, and in holiness” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/82.14" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 82:14</a>). One of the ways prescribed to achieve that increase is “every man seeking the interest of his neighbor, and doing all things with an eye single to the glory of God” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/82.19" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 82:19</a>).</p>

As we seek to be our brother’s keeper, we will be attempting to follow in the footsteps of the Master. I testify of Jesus Christ, our Savior, whose blood has atoned for repented sins and whose resurrection has broken the bands of death for all. The fulness of the gospel was restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith. His successor, President Ezra Taft Benson, holds the keys of the everlasting gospel in our day. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

Two of President Heber C. Kimball’s sons were called into military service for a three-month expedition against the Indians. Before they left he gave them a priesthood blessing. Apparently concerned that his sons might shed the blood of their Lamanite brothers, he first counseled them about the great promises God has made to this branch of the house of Israel. He then blessed his sons and promised them they would not see a single Indian on their campaign. His sons, full of fight and eager to smell gunpowder, were disappointed at this promise, but the blessing was fulfilled. When they returned three months later, they reported:</p>

Elder Nelson has described how that blessing was fulfilled by significant reductions in the risk of certain heart operations and in the time required for postoperative care. Eight years later, the man who had blessed him became his patient. Elder Spencer W. Kimball was scheduled for a complex heart operation. Presidents Harold B. Lee and N. Eldon Tanner blessed Dr. Nelson “that the operation would be performed without error, that all would go well, and that [he] need not fear for [his] own inadequacies, for [he] had been raised up by the Lord to perform this operation” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign, </span>May 1984, p. 88).

Think of a young man preparing to leave home to seek his fortune in the world. If his father gave him a compass, he might use this worldly tool to help him find his way. If his father gave him money, he could use this to give him power over worldly things. A priesthood blessing is a conferral of power over spiritual things. Though it cannot be touched or weighed, it is of great significance in helping us overcome obstacles on the path to eternal life.</p>

Blessings are sometimes pronounced on groups of people. The prophet Moses blessed all the children of Israel before his death (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/deut/33.1" class="scriptureRef">Deut. 33:1</a>). The Prophet Joseph Smith “pronounced a blessing upon the sisters” working on the Kirtland Temple. He also blessed “the congregation” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 2:399).

Before she began serving the women of Arizona, a priesthood leader blessed her that she would “always do only what was right and what was best for the welfare of her patients.” Over a period of forty-five years Sarah delivered approximately fifteen hundred babies without the loss of a single mother or child. “Whenever I came up against a difficult problem,” she recalled, “something always seemed to inspire me and somehow I would know what was the right thing to do” (L.

In the spring of 1844, some men were plotting against the Prophet Joseph Smith. One of the leaders, William Law, held a secret meeting at his home in Nauvoo. Among those invited were nineteen-year-old Dennison Lott Harris and his friend, Robert Scott. Dennison’s father, Emer Harris, who is my second great-grandfather, was also invited. He sought counsel from the Prophet Joseph Smith, who told him not to attend the meeting but to have the young men attend. The Prophet instructed them to pay close attention and report what was said.</p>

Again the Prophet asked them to attend, but he told them this would be their last meeting. “Be careful to remain silent and not to make any covenants or promises with them,” he counseled. He also cautioned them on the great danger of their mission. Although he thought it unlikely, it was possible they would be killed. Then, the Prophet Joseph Smith blessed Dennison and Robert by the power of the priesthood, promising them that if their lives were taken, their reward would be great.</p>

Then, when each person was required to take an oath to join the plot and keep it secret, they bravely refused. After everyone else had sworn secrecy, the whole group turned on Dennison and Robert, threatening to kill them unless they took the oath also. Because any refusal threatened the secrecy of their plans, about half of the plotters proposed to kill these two immediately. Knives were drawn, and angry men began to force them down into a basement to kill them.</p>

If they didn’t return, an alarm would be sounded and a search could reveal the boys’ deaths and the secret plans. During a long argument, two lives hung in the balance. Finally, the group decided to threaten to kill the young men if they ever revealed anything that had occurred and then to release them. This was done. Despite this threat, and because they had followed the Prophet’s counsel not to make any promises to the conspirators, Dennison and Robert promptly reported everything to the Prophet Joseph Smith.</p>

While Dennison L. Harris was serving as bishop of the Monroe Ward in southern Utah, he met a member of the First Presidency at a Church meeting in Ephraim. There, on Sunday, 15 May 1881, thirty-seven years after the Prophet Joseph Smith had sealed his lips to protect him against mob vengeance, Dennison Harris recited this experience to President Joseph F. Smith (see Verbal Statement of Bishop Dennison L.

This was the same instruction he gave when he introduced this ordinance nearly 2,000 years ago. Luke writes:</p>

Each Sabbath day millions of Latter-day Saints make this promise. What does it mean to “always remember” our Savior?</p>

	<p pid="zvlDFKCG-UiFsznKuXN6OQ" hash="K4F47A">To remember means to keep in memory. In the scriptures, it often means to keep a person in memory, together with associated emotions like love, loyalty, or gratitude. The stronger the emotion, the more vivid and influential the memory. Here are some examples:</p>

This kind of memory does not dim with the passing years, but with wisdom and perspective becomes ever more meaningful. As I grow older, I think more frequently of my father and my mother. I will always remember them.</p>
        </li>

          <p pid="R4j0QOhGDEOdauv2EPASyA" hash="h4TvRQ">Shortly before my wife was to give birth to our first child, we learned that the baby must be born by cesarean section. I was then a student at Brigham Young University, going to school full time and working almost full time. From my meager earnings, a little over $1.00 an hour, we had saved enough money for the hospital and doctor bills, but nothing in our plans or emotions had prepared us for this shocking announcement. We scarcely knew what a cesarean birth was, and we feared the worst.</p>
          <p pid="yRQ5QvxB20C0uI7MQVE__Q" hash="ks5e3g">A few days later we faced our ordeal. After what seemed an eternity, I stood at a window in the hospital hallway, looking into a basket containing our firstborn. The joy of seeing her and knowing that my beloved companion had survived the operation was inexpressible. As I experienced that moment, I became aware of a stranger standing beside me. He introduced himself as Dr. N. Frederick Hicken, the surgeon who had come from Salt Lake City to perform the operation. His presence reminded me that a surgeon’s fee had not been in our plans, and I began to ask him if I could pay his fee over a period of time. “Don’t worry about that, young man,” he said in a kindly way. “This is one from the Hickens to the Oakses.” Before I could stammer a thank-you, he was gone.</p>
          <p pid="kUcavPS4sEehmX8EHWZ3Aw" hash="8mSM5g">I was filled with wonder at this unexpected gift. Our benefactor must have known my father, a young medical doctor who died when I was a boy. He must have given us this gift because of something my father had done. I marveled at the goodness of this man who had come to us in our crisis and had, without recompense, used his powers to preserve the lives of those I loved. The emotion of that moment made the memory indelible. The name of that doctor is precious to me. I will always remember him.</p>

The credit belonged to wise and wonderful teachers who had taught me what to do and how to do it. My teachers were memorable. I shudder to think what I would have lost if teachers had not helped me want to learn and then taught me what I needed to know. I will always be grateful to my teachers. I will always remember them.</p>

          <span class="emphasis">Follow</span> is the word the Savior used when he called his helpers to the ministry. As he was walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two fishermen, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew, at work in their vocation. “And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/4.19" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 4:19</a>). “And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/1.18" class="scriptureRef">Mark 1:18</a>).</p>

In response, Jesus taught the parable of the unforgiving servant. This man owed a large debt to his king. When he begged for mercy, the king was moved with compassion and forgave the debt. But when a fellow servant owed him a debt, this man took his debtor by the throat and cast him into prison until he should pay it. When the unforgiving servant was brought to judgment, the king said:</p>

She asked me what could be done to help the single adult members of the Church with what she described as their “feelings of rejection, nonacceptance, and noncaring by their fellow Church members.” Judging from the letters we receive, I believe there are many thousands of single adult members, our brothers and sisters, with similar feelings.</p>

Some prominent theologians teach that our secularized world needs “a new concept of God,” stripped of the supernatural. They believe that not even a suffering God can help to solve the pain and tragedy of modern man. (See John A. Hardon, <span class="emphasis">Christianity in the Twentieth Century,</span> Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday and Co., 1971, pp. 356, 359.)</p>

A frequent teaching method in that discipline is to concentrate classroom instruction on the difficult questions—the obscure and debatable matters that lie at the fringes of learning. Some law teachers believe that the simple general rules that answer most legal questions are so obvious that students can learn them by independent study. As a result, these teachers devote little time to teaching the basics.</p>

I believe that the reason our Heavenly Father has had his prophet direct us into a more intensive study of the Book of Mormon is that this generation needs its message more than any of its forebears. As President Benson has said, the Book of Mormon “provides the most complete explanation of the doctrine of the Atonement,” and “its testimony of the Master is clear, undiluted, and full of power.” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1986, p. 5.)</p>

In this theology, human beings can be reconciled to God entirely through their own righteousness. (See O.

A great chorus of voices rises from the herd, but each lamb listens for the one voice that can guide it. The Savior used this ageless example in the allegory of the Good Shepherd. “The sheep hear his voice: … and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. And a stranger will they not follow, … for they know not the voice of strangers.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/10.3-5" class="scriptureRef">John 10:3–5</a>.)</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/alternate-voices.p4" pid="tEg3xzJdg0SpwgA4gSe8Og" hash="PUkmgQ">As Paul said to the Corinthians, “There are … so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14.10" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 14:10</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/alternate-voices.p5" pid="0DEcf1YA00W52qUP0n_cJw" hash="89Hl3A">Some voices speak of the things of the world, providing the useful information we need to make our way in mortality. I will make no further reference to these voices. My remarks will refer to those voices that speak of God, of his commandments, and of the doctrines, ordinances, and practices of his church. Some of those who speak on these subjects have been called and given divine authority to do so. Others, whom I choose to call alternate voices, speak on these subjects without calling or authority.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/alternate-voices.p6" pid="oen2Zsacy0KA30sJHymdgg" hash="1UgOCQ">In the five years since I was called as a General Authority, I have seen many instances where Church leaders and members have been troubled by things said by these alternate voices. I am convinced that some members are confused about the Church’s relationship to the alternate voices. As a result, members can be misled in their personal choices, and the work of the Lord can suffer.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/alternate-voices.p7" pid="_BI16nYJbEm6CWxlDnlYgw" hash="GgQJvA">Some alternate voices are those of well-motivated men and women who are merely trying to serve their brothers and sisters and further the cause of Zion. Their efforts fit within the Lord’s teaching that his servants should not have to be commanded in all things, but “should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.27" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 58:27</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/alternate-voices.p8" pid="Sz5cBG9KPU-yj8DtPGrPRw" hash="pdGW0Q">Other alternate voices are pursuing selfish personal interests, such as property, pride, prominence, or power. Other voices are the bleatings of lost souls who cannot hear the voice of the Shepherd and trot about trying to find their way without his guidance. Some of these voices call out guidance for others—the lost leading the lost.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/alternate-voices.p9" pid="hK_Hp9PaCUGfbsQB0HrmNg" hash="0Ki_gQ">Some alternate voices are of those whose avowed or secret object is to deceive and devour the flock. The Good Shepherd warned, “Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/7.15" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 7:15</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/14.15" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 14:15</a>.) In both the Bible and the Book of Mormon the Savior charged his shepherds to watch over and protect the flock from such wolves. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/20.28-29" class="scriptureRef">Acts 20:28–29</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.59" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:59</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/alternate-voices.p10" pid="EGCEGdkMX0WaY2tgVOFPvg" hash="l6xGHQ">There have always been alternate voices whose purpose or effect is to deceive. Their existence is part of the Plan. The prophet Lehi taught that there “must needs be … an opposition in <span class="emphasis">all</span> things.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.11" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:11</a>; italics added.) And there have always been other alternate voices whose purpose or effect is unselfish and wholesome.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/alternate-voices.p11" pid="vwxw8FGvQUud-VgFtUytuA" hash="Wr2o0A">In most instances, alternate voices are heard in the same kinds of communications the Church uses to perform its mission. The Church has magazines and other official publications, a newspaper supplement, letters from Church leaders, general conferences, and regular meetings and conferences in local units. Similarly, alternate voices are heard in magazines, journals, and newspapers and at lectures, symposia, and conferences.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/alternate-voices.p12" pid="s9FJ0BQfVE-L_KPLeaETAw" hash="E9tAhA">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints does not attempt to isolate its members from alternate voices. Its approach, as counseled by the Prophet Joseph Smith, is to teach correct principles and then leave its members to govern themselves by personal choices.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/alternate-voices.p13" pid="m-ztRsGuGkmhD3gBvLna-g" hash="JrMlxA">Of course, the Church does have a responsibility to point out what is the voice of the Church and what is not. This is especially necessary when some alternate voice, deliberately or inadvertently, communicates a message in a way that implies Church sponsorship or acquiescence.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/alternate-voices.p14" pid="1cm8Uzz2M0yYLouCWVn2lA" hash="X46Tpg">For the same reason, the Church does approve or disapprove those publications that are to be published or used in the official activities of the Church, general or local. For example, we have procedures to ensure approved content for materials published in the name of the Church or used for instruction in its classes. These procedures can be somewhat slow and cumbersome, but they have an important benefit. They provide a spiritual quality control that allows members to rely on the truth of what is said. Members who listen to the voice of the Church need not be on guard against being misled. They have no such assurance for what they hear from alternate voices.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/alternate-voices.p15" pid="A9xnOZZYh06QqJ4MaJCN2Q" hash="p6kV0A">Local Church leaders also have a responsibility to review the content of what is taught in classes or presented in worship services, as well as the spiritual qualifications of those they use as teachers or speakers. Leaders must do all they can to avoid expressed or implied Church endorsement for teachings that are not orthodox or for teachers who will use their Church position or prominence to promote something other than gospel truth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/alternate-voices.p16" pid="z_u62ESYEkub93R52q5rBA" hash="APRCqQ">Church leaders are sometimes invited to state the Church’s position at a debate or symposium about some doctrine, ordinance, or practice of the Church. This kind of presentation gives an audience the benefit of whatever illumination results from the adversarial clash of opposing viewpoints. Representatives of a business organization, a political party, or a social action group might welcome such an invitation. But the Church is directed to avoid disputation and contention. Moreover, if a representative of the Church participated in such an event, this could have the unwanted effect of encouraging Church members to look to the sponsors of alternate voices to bring them information on the positions of the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/alternate-voices.p17" pid="ksmIcsD0TEKLPgAkbS5Rhg" hash="txbpSQ">Members of the Church are free to participate or to listen to any alternate voices they choose, but Church leaders should avoid official involvement, directly or indirectly.</p>

In some instances, the overall presentation will be decidedly inaccurate or unfair because the position of the Church and the knowledge of its leaders are not presented. In other instances, a volunteer will step forward to present what he or she considers to be the Church’s position. Sometimes these volunteers are well-informed and capable, and they contribute to a balanced presentation. Sometimes they are not, and their contribution makes matters worse. When attacked by error, truth is better served by silence than by a bad argument.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/alternate-voices.p19" pid="JheUJo5Y7E2v4OyLb_3EIA" hash="feASGQ">In any case, volunteers do not speak for the Church. As long as Church leaders feel they should not participate in an event where the Church or its doctrines are discussed, the overall presentation will be incomplete and unbalanced. In such circumstances, no one should think that the Church’s silence constitutes an admission of facts asserted in that setting.</p>

The question is more complicated when the invitation does not relate to a publication or a lecture on a single subject, but to a group of articles, a series of publications, or a conference or symposium with a large number of subjects. One article or one issue of a publication or one session of a conference may be edifying and uplifting, something a faithful Latter-day Saint would wish to support or enjoy. But another article or another session may be destructive, something a faithful Latter-day Saint would not wish to support or promote.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/alternate-voices.p21" pid="csAOmbuQlE-951z3zjYGdA" hash="d7mzDA">Some of life’s most complicated decisions involve mixtures of good and evil. To what extent can one seek the benefit of something good one desires when this can only be done by simultaneously promoting something bad one opposes? That is a personal decision, but it needs to be made with a sophisticated view of the entire circumstance and with a prayer for heavenly guidance.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/alternate-voices.p22" pid="VfIRNRhCoEu4aTwLXw2Khg" hash="SYIWpA">There are surely limits at which every faithful Latter-day Saint would draw the line. For example, in my view a person who has made covenants in the holy temple would not make his or her influence available to support or promote a source that publishes or discusses the temple ceremonies, even if other parts of the publication or program are unobjectionable. I would not want my support or my name used to further a public discussion of things I have covenanted to hold sacred.</p>

For example, a frequent technique of scholarship is debate or adversarial discussion, a method with which I have had considerable personal experience. But the Lord has instructed us in ancient and modern scriptures that we should not contend over the points of his doctrine. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.28-30" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 11:28–30</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/10.63" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 10:63</a>.)

Similarly, techniques devised for adversary debate or to search out differences and work out compromises are not effective in acquiring gospel knowledge. Gospel truths and testimony are received from the Holy Ghost through reverent personal study and quiet contemplation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/alternate-voices.p35" pid="2asNJ9fVL0-vpvt6b0jyhg" hash="pSRX1A">In the scriptures, the Lord has specified how we learn by faith. We must be humble, cultivate faith, repent of our sins, serve our fellowmen, and keep the commandments of God.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/alternate-voices.p36" pid="GptcqICTZE6W6sGSaIPxgg" hash="YpaIng">I have seen some persons attempt to understand or undertake to criticize the gospel or the Church by the method of reason alone, unaccompanied by the use or recognition of revelation. When reason is adopted as the only—or even the principal—method of judging the gospel, the outcome is predetermined. One cannot find God or understand his doctrines and ordinances by closing the door on the means He has prescribed for receiving the truths of his gospel. That is why gospel truths have been corrupted and gospel ordinances have been lost when left to the interpretation and sponsorship of scholars who lack the authority and reject the revelations of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/alternate-voices.p37" pid="Yf1H5bk1TES6AcMEPyzvTw" hash="VKYJ3Q">That is what the Savior told his professional critics, as recorded in the eleventh chapter of Luke. He was confronted by a group who had hypocritically built monuments to the prophets their predecessors had murdered, while personally rejecting the living prophets God was sending them. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/11.47-49" class="scriptureRef">Luke 11:47–49</a>.) In what I understand to be a condemnation of their rejection of revelation, the Savior pronounced woe upon these worldly professionals: “For ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/11.52" class="scriptureRef">Luke 11:52</a>.)</p>

He failed because he “took no thought,” but only asked God. (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/9.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 9:7</a>.) The Lord told him he should have “stud[ied] it out in [his] mind” and then asked if it was right. (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/9.8" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 9:8</a>.) Only then would the Lord reveal whether the translation was correct or not. And only on receiving that revelation could the text be written, because “you cannot write that which is sacred save it be given you from me.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/9.9" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 9:9</a>.) In the acquisition of sacred knowledge, scholarship and reason are not alternatives to revelation. They are a means to an end, and the end is revelation from God.</p>

Reuben Clark spoke words that apply to pioneers in every age. In his description of “Them of the Last Wagon,” President Clark paid tribute to the rank and file, “those great souls, … in name unknown, unremembered, unhonored in the pages of history, but lovingly revered round the hearthstones of their children and their children’s children.” (<span class="emphasis">J.

In the wagon trains, the leaders were “out in front where the air was clear and clean and where they had unbroken vision of the blue vault of heaven.” (<span class="emphasis">J. Reuben Clark: Selected Papers,</span> p. 69.) But, as President Clark observed, “Back in the last wagon, not always could they see the brethren way out in front and the blue heaven was often shut out from their sight by heavy, dense clouds of the dust of the earth. Yet day after day, they of the last wagon pressed forward, worn and tired, footsore, sometimes almost disheartened, borne up by their faith that God loved them, that the Restored Gospel was true, and that the Lord led and directed the brethren out in front.” (Ibid.)</p>

In every nation, in every worthy occupation and activity, members of this church face hardships, overcome obstacles, and follow the servants of the Lord Jesus Christ as valiantly as the pioneers of any age. They pay their tithes and offerings. They serve as missionaries or as Church Service volunteers, or they support others who do so. Like the noble young mothers who postpone the pursuit of their personal goals in order to provide the needs of their children, they sacrifice immediate pleasures to keep commitments that are eternal. They accept callings and, in the service of others, they willingly give their time and sometimes their lives.</p>

The criteria for that ultimate goal is the same for every person—leader or follower, prominent or obscure: Have we received the ordinances of salvation and kept our covenants? A member of the Church in Great Britain said it best. He had served as stake president. As that period of prominence came to an end, he told Elder Boyd K.

It has brought me so close to my Heavenly Father and particularly to the Lord Jesus Christ. It is a feeling that I’m not sure can be expressed in words. I literally came before the Lord with a broken heart and a contrite spirit. No physical pain I have ever experienced has been as painful as the emotional pain I have felt.

One of those duties was “to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in, even until death.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.9" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 18:9</a>.)</p>

The original Apostles were eyewitnesses to the ministry and resurrection of the Savior. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/10.39-41" class="scriptureRef">Acts 10:39–41</a>.) He told them, “Ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/1.8" class="scriptureRef">Acts 1:8</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/10.42-43" class="scriptureRef">Acts 10:42–43</a>.) However, he cautioned them that their witnessing would be after they had received the Holy Ghost. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/1.8" class="scriptureRef">Acts 1:8</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/24.49" class="scriptureRef">Luke 24:49</a>.)</p>

Even the witness and testimony of the original Apostles had to be rooted in the testimony of the Holy Ghost. A prophet has told us that the witness of the Holy Ghost makes an impression on our soul that is more significant than “a visitation of an angel.” (Joseph Fielding Smith, <span class="emphasis">Doctrines of Salvation,</span> comp. Bruce R. McConkie, Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1954, 1:44.) And the Bible shows that when we testify on the basis of this witness, the Holy Ghost testifies to those who hear our words. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/2.title" class="scriptureRef">Acts 2</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/10.44-47" class="scriptureRef">Acts 10:44–47</a>.)</p>

Then Peter added, “And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/5.32" class="scriptureRef">Acts 5:32</a>.) The mission of the Holy Ghost is to witness of the Father and the Son. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.18" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 31:18</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/28.11" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 28:11</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.27" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:27</a>.)

In obedience to the law of Moses, Joseph and Mary brought the infant Jesus to the temple at Jerusalem after forty days, to present him to the Lord. There, two aged and spiritual temple workers received a witness of his identity and testified of him. Simeon, who had known by revelation from the Holy Ghost that he should not taste of death until he had seen the Messiah, took the infant in his arms and testified to his divine mission. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/2.25-35" class="scriptureRef">Luke 2:25–35</a>.) Anna, whom the scripture called “a prophetess” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/2.36" class="scriptureRef">Luke 2:36</a>), recognized the Messiah “and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/2.38" class="scriptureRef">Luke 2:38</a>).</p>

Therefore, we can properly say that when each received this witness, Simeon was a prophet and Anna was a prophetess. Each then fulfilled the prophetic duty to testify to those around them. As Peter said, “To [Christ] give all the prophets witness.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/10.43" class="scriptureRef">Acts 10:43</a>.) This was what Moses meant when he expressed the wish “that all the Lord’s people were prophets, and that the Lord would put his spirit upon them!” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/num/11.29" class="scriptureRef">Num. 11:29</a>.)</p>

The Book of Mormon tells of King Lamoni and his queen, who testified of their Redeemer. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/19.title" class="scriptureRef">Alma 19</a>.) The Bible describes the witness of the Holy Ghost coming upon the kinsmen and friends of Cornelius, who were then heard to “magnify God.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/10.24,46" class="scriptureRef">Acts 10:24, 46</a>.)</p>

Those who receive that gift have the duty to testify of it.

True, the fulness of his doctrine and the power of his priesthood had been lost from the earth, but there were many good and honorable men and women who were valiant in their own testimonies of Jesus. Our earliest missionaries concentrated their message on the Restoration—the calling of the Prophet Joseph Smith and the restoring of priesthood authority—since they could assume that most of those they taught had a fundamental belief in Jesus Christ as our Savior.</p>

Lee said: “Fifty years ago or more, when I was a missionary, our greatest responsibility was to defend the great truth that the Prophet Joseph Smith was divinely called and inspired and that the Book of Mormon was indeed the word of God. But even at that time there were the unmistakable evidences that there was coming into the religious world actually a question about the Bible and about the divine calling of the Master, himself. Now, fifty years later, our greatest responsibility and anxiety is to defend the divine mission of our Lord and Master, Jesus Christ, for all about us, even among those who claim to be professors of the Christian faith, are those not willing to stand squarely in defense of the great truth that our Lord and Master, Jesus Christ, was indeed the Son of God.” (Address to LDS Student Association Fireside, Utah State University, 10 Oct. 1971.)</p>

For example, a national magazine recently reported an innovation by a new bishop of a prominent Christian church. Their ministers have always consecrated the emblems of the flesh and blood of Jesus Christ in the name of the “Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.” However, in an effort to use what are called “nonsexist words,” this new bishop has begun to consecrate the eucharist in the name of the “Creator, Redeemer, and Sustainer.” (“Fretful Murmur in the Cathedral,” <span class="emphasis">Insight,</span> 24 Apr. 1989, p. 47.)

Some have encouraged parents to distribute their property and then have put them away in institutions, sometimes with inadequate care and sometimes without regular visits and expressions of love from their children.

It was a unique Utah Mormon institution. It began in 1875, when Charles R. Savage, the pioneer photographer, persuaded Presiding Bishop Edward Hunter to declare a day for honoring what we now call senior citizens.

Since that time we have had further increases in the number of senior citizens in our midst, but perhaps not significant increases in the amount of honor accorded them. Fortunately, the advances in medical science that have produced increased longevity have also increased our senior citizens’ effective participation in church, community, business, and social events. But the need for honor, especially for our fathers and our mothers, is undiminished.</p>

Then a widow about eighty-five years of age, Grandma Call was a survivor of what older people called “the exodus.” She had been among those valiant Latter-day Saints expelled from northern Mexico in 1912.

There are frequent visits and phone calls and invitations that include her in all the family activities she desires. I believe her days will be longer upon the land because of the attentiveness and companionship of her children, who learned the way to honor a parent by seeing how their own mother honored hers.</p>

Joy is more than happiness. Joy is the ultimate sensation of well-being. It comes from being complete and in harmony with our Creator and his eternal laws.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/joy-and-mercy.p2" pid="iSTuZQQgn0GE9DkiVF7Myg" hash="P6O4Kg">The opposite of joy is misery. Misery is more than unhappiness, sorrow, or suffering. Misery is the ultimate state of disharmony with God and his laws.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/joy-and-mercy.p3" pid="w1OrjE-hB0e2bskIwINvbA" hash="B6_QDQ">Joy and misery are eternal emotions whose ultimate extent we are not likely to experience in mortality. In this life we have some mortal simulations, which we call happiness or pleasure and unhappiness or pain. In the midst of these emotions is suffering. Some suffering comes from our own sins or those of others, but much suffering is simply an inevitable part of the mortal condition, like an accidental injury.</p>

As part of an outing, a group of Latter-day Saint Boy Scouts entered an abandoned mine in the mountains not far from here. Somehow, young Joshua Dennis was separated from the group and became lost in the mine. Anyone who has ever lost something valuable will remember that terrible feeling. The pain is most extreme when we have lost a loved one. Joshua’s family and friends feared their loss might be permanent.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/joy-and-mercy.p5" pid="lLTsIBuNaUCrOASqsxrukQ" hash="YABrgA">Search efforts were organized. For days, many good people dropped everything they were doing to search for the one who was lost. Many shared the pain of his loss. Then, miraculously, he was found. Prayers were answered, and the mercy of a loving Heavenly Father was manifest in the happiness of family and friends reunited with the one who was lost. The pain of loss turned to the overwhelming joy of reunion. (See <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Aug. 1991, pp. 30–35.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/joy-and-mercy.p6" pid="jMnVNV1zV0WWdI6uO_QNsg" hash="YSYPxg">Few experiences illustrate mortal feelings of joy better than the recovery of something precious we fear we have lost. The scriptures illustrate this experience. In the parable of the lost sheep, the shepherd invited his friends to rejoice with him, for he had “found [his] sheep which was lost.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/15.6" class="scriptureRef">Luke 15:6</a>.) “Likewise,” Jesus explained, “joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/15.7" class="scriptureRef">Luke 15:7</a>.) In another parable, a father rejoiced in the return of a prodigal son, explaining, “For this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/15.32" class="scriptureRef">Luke 15:32</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/joy-and-mercy.p7" pid="EO2T4rqXjkGlDuxlwOK40Q" hash="gBQbwQ">These experiences are symbolic of our eternal journey. The Fall has separated us from our heavenly home. We must choose which way we will go. Satan, who was separated from God and permanently lost, would like to see our separation become permanent also. Father Lehi taught that Satan’s purpose is to make men miserable. “Because he had fallen from heaven, and had become miserable forever, [Satan] sought also the misery of all mankind.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.18" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:18</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.27" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:27</a>.) Those who yield to his enticings are on the way to the same miserable destiny as he. Shut out from the presence of God, they will be in “a state of misery and endless torment.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.25" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 3:25</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.5" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:5</a>.) As the Lord said about the wicked, “misery shall be their doom.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.37" class="scriptureRef">Moses 7:37</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/joy-and-mercy.p8" pid="m4A_C3eF5E2-raifvnSQFg" hash="70Nsug">Much of the misery encouraged by Satan comes from losses. Satan experienced that kind of misery when he lost his first estate. Now he tries to inflict similar losses on those who have proceeded to mortality, the second estate. Satan encourages a loss of virtue, a loss of integrity, a loss of reputation, a loss of ideals, a loss of wholesome associations, and even a loss of life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/joy-and-mercy.p9" pid="ounpejsGIkODjCuUTHtdNQ" hash="H8OWZA">In contrast, our Heavenly Father created us to resist and to overcome such losses, to be whole, to have joy. He wants us to return to him, and he has provided a way for that reunion to be achieved. No wonder we say that his gospel is “a voice of mercy from heaven; … a voice of gladness for the living and the dead; glad tidings of great joy.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/128.19" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 128:19</a>.)</p>

The things of the earth were created for our happiness. Modern revelation tells us that “all things which come of the earth … are made for the benefit and the use of man, both to please the eye and to gladden the heart.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.18" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:18</a>.) Even on the Sabbath, a day of worship, the Lord expects us to have “a glad heart and a cheerful countenance.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.15" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:15</a>.) A prophet has called the gospel plan “the great plan of happiness.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/42.8" class="scriptureRef">Alma 42:8</a>.)</p>

King Benjamin invited his people to consider “the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold,” he said, “they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven … [to] dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.41" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 2:41</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/joy-and-mercy.p12" pid="MPV-Q_I6X0iV5_ThdXHPMA" hash="eVwgwg">Father Lehi explained that if Adam and Eve had not gone through the process we call the Fall, they would have remained forever in their initial state of innocence, “having no joy, for they knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.23" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:23</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/joy-and-mercy.p13" pid="hheWcddvvEuPxKMDzTOSQg" hash="_ZZTcQ">Our first parents recognized this principle. When the Holy Ghost fell upon them and bore record of the Father and the Son, Adam blessed the name of the Lord, declaring that “because of my transgression my eyes are opened, and in this life I shall have joy.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.10" class="scriptureRef">Moses 5:10</a>.) With inspired insight, Eve explained the purpose of life and the source of joy:</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/joy-and-mercy.p15" pid="B1sqvzgVYUa6mKtnurjlOw" hash="aYXmjw">When I think of happiness or joy in this life, I begin with some experiences that are simple and basic. I see the expression on the face of a one-year-old taking those first steps. I remember a two-year-old immersed in a soft ice cream cone. I think of a child loving a puppy or a kitten.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/joy-and-mercy.p16" pid="ZNl_zZpI30u03iB1g5nCBw" hash="5xptTA">If the more mature have not dulled their physical or spiritual sensitivities by excess or disuse, they can also experience joy in what is simple and basic—in flowers and other growing things, in a sunrise or sunset or other beauties of nature, in wholesome companionship.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/joy-and-mercy.p17" pid="mhBSkNfGlk6b1Q_aPq-zgA" hash="yNW1nQ">Another source of happiness and mortal joy is the accomplishment of worthy goals, simple things like physical exercise or more complex goals like the completion of an arduous task.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/joy-and-mercy.p18" pid="OSD8yxR6VkKajiqZJVDwMQ" hash="jwDGVQ">Other goals have eternal significance. Their completion produces joy in this life and the promise of eternal joy in the world to come. A few weeks ago Elder Rex D. Pinegar and I saw an example of this as we visited the beautifully renovated temple in Cardston, Alberta. In the brides’ room stood a lovely young woman in her wedding dress. She was there because she had made righteous choices. The look in her eyes and the expression on her face were a perfect embodiment of joy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/joy-and-mercy.p19" pid="gf1Vpjmgn0quQTA65mlFTg" hash="YbOJnQ">But despite all we can do, we cannot have a fulness of joy in this world or through our own efforts. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.36" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 101:36</a>.) Only in Christ can our joy be full. This is why the angel proclaimed: “I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.</p>

That joy, of course, comes only through the mercy of the Holy Messiah, whose resurrection broke the bands of death and whose atonement unlocks the reservoir of mercy by which we can be cleansed of our sins and come into the presence of God to receive the fulness of the Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/joy-and-mercy.p22" pid="jiFioO8WEEuqWrBw6DV0tg" hash="VFj_kQ">We joyously proclaim that “there is no flesh that can dwell in the presence of God, save it be through the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.8" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:8</a>.) God’s mercy is the only source of the ultimate and eternal joy, which restores every loss, dries every tear, and erases every pain. Eternal joy transcends all suffering. In this life and in the life to come, that joy comes about through the Resurrection and the remission of sins.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/joy-and-mercy.p23" pid="8diUzuvfpkyJ6wXGj6Jl1Q" hash="csC8Rg">Remembering his early life, Alma told how his sins caused him to be “tormented with the pains of hell.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/36.13" class="scriptureRef">Alma 36:13</a>.) He said he was “racked, even with the pains of a damned soul.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/36.16" class="scriptureRef">Alma 36:16</a>.) At length he remembered his father’s teachings about the Savior, who would atone for the sins of the world. He cried out, “O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/36.18" class="scriptureRef">Alma 36:18</a>.)</p>

In his words, “Oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my soul was filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain!” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/36.20" class="scriptureRef">Alma 36:20</a>.)</p>

Physical pain ends with death. Spiritual pain, or misery, is everlasting, unless we repent.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/joy-and-mercy.p26" pid="J4YKkMKv7k-AViGwm8QMdw" hash="zcritw">The Book of Mormon tells of an entire people who received a remission of their sins and “were filled with joy” and “peace of conscience.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.3" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 4:3</a>.) King Benjamin reminded them that they had “received a remission of [their] sins, which causeth such exceedingly great joy in [their] souls.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.11" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 4:11</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/joy-and-mercy.p27" pid="jxvhWsBOl0-gHiCw5KimJg" hash="03qalw">The joy that follows the remission of sins comes from the Spirit of the Lord. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.3,20" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 4:3, 20</a>.) It is a fulfillment of the Lord’s promise that “I will impart unto you of my Spirit, … which shall fill your soul with joy.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/11.13" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 11:13</a>.) As the Apostle Paul taught, “the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/gal/5.22" class="scriptureRef">Gal. 5:22</a>.) It comes in the same way to everyone—to rich and poor, to the prominent and the obscure. In conferring his greatest gift of mercy through the Atonement, God is not a respecter of persons.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/joy-and-mercy.p28" pid="qsk7jyJHcEqgB6vkpYkDhw" hash="ZKKNRQ">In contrast, those who yield to the enticing of Satan may, as the scripture says, “enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/11.25" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 11:25</a>), but that kind of pleasure can never lead to lasting happiness or eternal joy. The spirit and influence of Satan bring feelings of confusion, contention, darkness, disorder, anger, hate, and misery.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/joy-and-mercy.p29" pid="7gz9XkLi3EeBUe9koy88Nw" hash="cS_npA">Persons who pursue Satan’s way are certain to have Satan’s misery. Unless they repent they will “remain with the father of lies, in misery, like unto himself.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.9" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 9:9</a>.) As Alma said to his wayward son, “wickedness never was happiness.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/41.10" class="scriptureRef">Alma 41:10</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/joy-and-mercy.p30" pid="-hbGC2fmREGjufPQmS7dsA" hash="K1gMtA">Our personal experiences and almost every newscast and newspaper remind us of the unhappiness and pain suffered on this earth. Some of this is traceable to sin. Many letters sent to Church headquarters describe the pain people inflict upon one another, often within those family relationships that should be the source of life’s greatest joy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/joy-and-mercy.p31" pid="NtVakRvnQUqNkgL8EQkIEw" hash="Ib81sw">We have seen the pain of parents when their children stray from the path of truth. We have seen the pain that comes when a wife abandons her family and flies off to seek pleasure in forbidden paths, like a moth to a flame. We have seen the pain that comes in those more numerous instances when a husband abandons his wife and children in his self-destructive search for pleasure.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/joy-and-mercy.p32" pid="mLx8DJaMDEq_YDmyBNxvvw" hash="Vd7n0Q">Other unhappiness results from the lust for power and wealth. A few weeks ago some of my Brethren and I visited a country that had been ruled for decades by an oppressive dictatorship, recently overthrown. We saw the conditions produced by rulers who had gratified their lusts at the expense of their people. Their palaces stood in shameful contrast to the workers’ apartment houses built without indoor plumbing. Everywhere we saw the ugly effects of the neglect of public services. Truly, the Proverbs say, “When the wicked … rule, the people mourn.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/prov/29.2" class="scriptureRef">Prov. 29:2</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/joy-and-mercy.p33" pid="VMVIB7vtW0qhaKyUV-RoCg" hash="mACIZg">The consequences of wickedness are far-reaching. They continue from generation to generation. The pitiful victims of physical and sexual and emotional abuse are more susceptible to Satan’s manipulations. They are more likely to perpetuate these ugly transgressions within their own family relationships. Like highly contagious physical ailments, the spiritual diseases of lust and greed and corruption spread their evil effects, and Satan rejoices in the unhappiness and pain they cause in each succeeding generation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/joy-and-mercy.p34" pid="cgeFzdTKoEajn9GWaDs-wg" hash="tbiLQg">Brothers and sisters, old and young, I plead with each of you to remember that wickedness never was happiness and that sin leads to misery. Young people, do not seek happiness in the glittering but shallow things of the world. We cannot achieve lasting happiness by pursuing the wrong things. Someone once said, “You can never get enough of what you don’t need, because what you don’t need won’t satisfy you.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/joy-and-mercy.p35" pid="cQ5eY-mrFkmPDheJxRaL5g" hash="R3MbUw">Young and old, turn your eyes and your hearts away from the deceptive messages of the media. There is no happiness in alcohol or drugs, only enslavement. There is no happiness in violence, only pain and sorrow. There is no happiness in sexual relations and physical familiarities outside the bonds of marriage, only degradation and increased momentum along the way to spiritual death.</p>

The effects of righteous examples are felt for generations to come. Good parenting produces youth who make good parents. Just as many of us have been strengthened by the noble examples of our pioneering ancestors in many lands, so the righteous choices and sacrifices of our day can bless our families and our friends and our nations for all the years to come.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/joy-and-mercy.p38" pid="JxUTboO85UW1EJ-HHvj7jQ" hash="4kkQfA">We appreciate the work of our <span class="emphasis">Church News</span> and our Church magazines, which share worthy and wholesome examples for the strengthening of all.

I testify of God the Eternal Father and his Son Jesus Christ, the authors of the great plan of happiness and mercy.

Last month’s anniversary program was carried by satellite to most continents of the world. Books are being published to review the history and celebrate the worldwide sisterhood of Relief Society. Ward and stake Relief Societies are celebrating through service in their local communities. Far-reaching efforts to promote literacy will be formally announced later this year.</p>

At the first meeting, President Emma Smith said, “Each member should be ambitious to do good.” (Minutes of the Female Relief Society of Nauvoo, 17 Mar. 1842, p. 13; <span class="emphasis">Ensign, </span>Mar. 1992, p. 4. Hereafter, quotes are taken from original documents, referred to as Minutes.) The minutes of those initial meetings are filled with accounts of how the sisters obtained work opportunities for the needy, took in the homeless, and made donations to help those in need of food, shelter, and schooling.</p>

In a session of conference, President Brigham Young announced that the Saints in two handcart companies were stranded by early snows and suffering in the mountains of Wyoming. He called for immediate help to rescue them, and before they left the Tabernacle many sisters had begun to gather clothing to send to the Saints in the mountains. (See Kenneth W. Godfrey et al., <span class="emphasis">Women’s Voices: An Untold History of the Latter-day Saints, 1830–1900, </span>Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1982, p. 269.)</p>

A later First Presidency explained: “One of the purposes of the organization of the Relief Society was that a system might be inaugurated by which study of religious subjects, or Church doctrine and government, might be pursued by women. The administration of charity under the direction of the Bishopric … was to be part of their active work. But this was not intended to absorb their activities to the exclusion of the development of faith, and the advancement of women in literary, social and domestic activities of life.” (James R. Clark, comp., <span class="emphasis">Messages of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, </span>6 vols., Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1965–75, 5:217.)</p>

Widtsoe later declared. “Relief of poverty, relief of illness; relief of doubt, relief of ignorance—relief of all that hinders the joy and progress of woman. What a magnificent commission!” (John A. Widtsoe, <span class="emphasis">Evidences and Reconciliations, </span>Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1987, p. 308.)</p>

In a revelation given in 1830, the Lord told Emma Smith that the Prophet would authorize her “to expound scriptures, and to exhort the church, according as it shall be given thee by my Spirit.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/25.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 25:7</a>.) When she was later selected to lead the Relief Society, her prophet husband referred to this revelation that she would “expound the scriptures to all” and “teach the female part of the community.” He declared “that not she alone, but others, may attain to the same blessings.” (Minutes, 17 Mar. 1842, p. 8.)</p>

Desiring to organize a society to promote sisterhood and to accomplish benevolent works, a group of women asked Eliza R. Snow to draft a constitution and bylaws. When Joseph Smith learned of this, he asked that the sisters be called together so that he could provide “something better for them than a written Constitution.” One sister recalled his saying, “I will organize the women under the priesthood after the pattern of the priesthood.” (Sarah M. Kimball, “Auto-Biography,” <span class="emphasis">Woman’s Exponent, </span>1 Sept. 1883, p. 51.)</p>

From these minutes we know the substance of the Prophet Joseph Smith’s instructions to the new organization and its members. This anniversary is an appropriate time to recall and reemphasize these prophetic directions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/the-relief-society-and-the-church.p15" pid="O6CHJfia4k20-Jk6ZuLL9A" hash="g6M3cw">In his first formal instruction to the newly founded organization, the Prophet said he was “deeply interested that [the Relief Society] might be built up to the Most High in an acceptable manner.” He taught that “when instructed we must obey that voice … that the blessings of heaven may rest down upon us—all must act in concert or nothing can be done—that the Society should move according to the ancient Priesthood.” (Minutes, 30 Mar. 1842, p. 22.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/the-relief-society-and-the-church.p16" pid="z7byodaTUUSvn-isuaBQbw" hash="TR0cqw">The Prophet’s counsel apparently sought to give this new organization the benefit of an early revelation in which the Lord instructed the newly organized First Presidency “how you may act before me, that it may turn to you for your salvation.</p>

The Relief Society’s promised blessings were dependent upon its leaders and members functioning within the limits the Lord had set.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/the-relief-society-and-the-church.p18" pid="MZAPlKWhuU-rIhkVFTHSJw" hash="_RKvaA">The next time he met with the Relief Society, Joseph Smith “exhorted the sisters always to concentrate their faith and prayers for, and place confidence in those whom God has appointed to honor, whom God has placed at the head to lead.” (Minutes, 28 Apr. 1842, p. 37.) This counsel, of course, furthered the direction in the earlier revelation on priesthood, which declared that all “authorities or offices in the church are appendages” to the Melchizedek Priesthood and that this priesthood “holds the right of presidency, and has power and authority over all the offices in the church in all ages of the world.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.5,8" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 107:5, 8</a>.) Consequently, the Relief Society and the auxiliaries organized later have always functioned and have thrived under the direction of the presiding authorities of the priesthood.</p>

Hinckley recently characterized as “a charter … of the Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign, </span>Mar. 1992, p. 4):</p>

Like the quorums of priesthood holders in the Church, the Relief Society was to be self-governing, but it was not to be an independent organization. It was an integral part of the Church, not a separate church for women.</p>

This opened to women new opportunities for receiving knowledge and intelligence from on high, such as through the temple ordinances that were soon to be instituted. Similarly, as the Prophet promised them in connection with their charitable service, “If you live up to your privileges, the angels cannot be restrained from being your associates.” (Minutes, 28 Apr. 1842, p. 38.)</p>

President Smith explained: “While the sisters have not been given the Priesthood, … that does not mean that the Lord has not given unto them authority. Authority and Priesthood are two different things. A person may have authority given to him, or a sister to her, to do certain things in the Church that are binding and absolutely necessary for our salvation, such as the work that our sisters do in the House of the Lord.” (<span class="emphasis">Relief Society Magazine, </span>Jan. 1959, p. 4.)</p>

Keys are conferred on individuals, not organizations. The same is true of priesthood authority and of the related authority exercised under priesthood direction. Organizations may channel the exercise of such authority, but they do not embody it. Thus, the priesthood keys were delivered to the members of the First Presidency and the Quorum of Twelve Apostles, not to any organizations. (See Topical Guide, “Priesthood, keys of.”)</p>

A stake Relief Society president presides and exercises authority over the function to which she has been called. The same is true for the other auxiliaries. Similarly, women called as missionaries are set apart to go forth with authority to teach the everlasting gospel, and women called to work in a temple are given authority for the sacred functions to which they have been called. All function under the direction of the priesthood leader who has been given the priesthood keys to direct those who labor in his area of responsibility.</p>

Being organized under priesthood authority, they were to reject worldly concepts of power and seek the power that flows down from heaven for those functions and to those individuals who are using their time and talents in the Lord’s way.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/the-relief-society-and-the-church.p29" pid="Kp_mPPPLCUq6XE7YPdgxQw" hash="3DFlUQ">In considering the Prophet’s instructions to the first Relief Society, we should remember that in those earliest days in Church history more revelation was to come. Thus, when he spoke to the sisters about the appropriateness of their laying on hands to bless one another, the Prophet cautioned “that the time had not been before that these things could be in their proper order—that the Church is not now organized in its proper order, and cannot be until the Temple is completed.” (Minutes, 28 Apr. 1842, p. 36.) During the century that followed, as temples became accessible to most members, “proper order” required that these and other sacred practices be confined within those temples.</p>

Lee repeatedly told men that “the most important of the Lord’s work you will ever do will be within the walls of your own home.” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign, </span>Feb. 1972, p. 51.) That direction also applies to women, and it should engage the best teaching efforts of the Relief Society. We cannot overstate the supreme importance of the task our Father in Heaven has assigned to the mothers, who are the teachers and workers and standard-setters in the homes of the Latter-day Saints. The mothers in those homes give the impressionable sons and daughters of God their earliest and most formative orientation for their mortal journey toward eternal life.</p>

While we sometimes refer to priesthood holders as “the priesthood,” we must never forget that the priesthood is not owned by or embodied in those who hold it. It is held in a sacred trust to be used for the benefit of men, women, and children alike. Elder John A. Widtsoe said, “Men have no greater claim than women upon the blessings that issue from the Priesthood and accompany its possession.” (<span class="emphasis">Priesthood and Church Government, </span>Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1938, p. 83.) For example, our young women should have just as many opportunities for blessings from priesthood leaders as our young men.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/the-relief-society-and-the-church.p33" pid="RtWGTnbI5UiahwwrvSozng" hash="sHI9CQ">Some leaders at various levels of the Church have neglected to apply these basic principles. Some have failed to have the regular consultation with auxiliary leaders that is specified in our Church handbooks of instruction. President Spencer W. Kimball taught the governing principle to the priesthood leaders of the Church when he said: “Our sisters do not wish to be indulged or to be treated condescendingly; they desire to be respected and revered as our sisters and our equals. I mention all these things, my brethren, not because the doctrines or the teachings of the Church regarding women are in any doubt, but because in some situations our behavior is of doubtful quality.” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign, </span>Nov. 1979, p. 49.)</p>

But all should remember that neither sisterhood nor brotherhood is an end in itself. Each is a means of individual spiritual growth and cooperative service. The ultimate and highest expression of womanhood and manhood is in the new and everlasting covenant of marriage between a man and a woman. Only this relationship culminates in exaltation. As the Apostle Paul taught, “Neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/11.11" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 11:11</a>.) Thus, the common objective of brotherhood in our priesthood quorums and sisterhood in our Relief Societies is to bring men and women together in the sacred marriage and family relationships that lead toward eternal life, “the greatest of all the gifts of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/14.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 14:7</a>.)</p>

Like most young men, Isaac was curious. He saw the fire and the wood and the knife they carried, “but,” he asked his father, “where is the lamb for a burnt offering?” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/22.7" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 22:7</a>.) I did not realize until I had sons of my own how much pain Abraham must have felt when he answered simply, “My son, God will provide.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/22.8" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 22:8</a>.)</p>

What did Isaac think when Abraham did such a strange thing? The Bible mentions no struggle or objection.

When I was older, I learned that the experience of Abraham and Isaac was what the scriptures call a <span class="emphasis">type,</span> which is a likeness or reminder of something else. The Book of Mormon prophet Jacob said that the command for Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac was “a similitude of God and his Only Begotten Son.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4.5" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 4:5</a>.)</p>

Though only a slave, Joseph’s abilities were so impressive to his master that he was put in charge of all that his master had, in the house and in the field. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/39.4-6" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 39:4–6</a>.) Then, in that position of prominence and power, Joseph met a test.</p>

Joseph rejected her advances, telling her he would not betray the trust of her husband, or the even greater trust he would violate by sinning against God in doing what Joseph called “this great wickedness.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/39.9" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 39:9</a>.) He rejected her again and again. Then one day, when no one else was in the house, she seized hold of his clothing. In a marvelously vivid description, the scripture says, “And he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/39.12" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 39:12</a>.)</p>

Be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38.42" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 38:42</a>.)

After seizing Joseph and throwing him into a pit, they decided to sell him into slavery instead. Even as they told their father that Joseph had been killed by wild beasts, the traders who had purchased him on the plains of Canaan were leading him down into Egypt and slavery. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/37.title" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 37</a>.)</p>

But even there he excelled, and the Lord blessed him. In time he came forth to interpret Pharaoh’s dream, and he was made ruler of all Egypt. In that powerful position, he became the instrument to save his people from famine and to love and forgive the brothers who had wronged him.

The first time I read the Book of Mormon, I found the statement that “Joseph … who was sold into Egypt … was preserved by the hand of the Lord.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/5.14" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 5:14</a>.) In later readings in the scriptures, I found that this kind of protection is available to all. For example, the Bible states that “the Lord preserveth the faithful” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/31.23" class="scriptureRef">Ps. 31:23</a>), and that God “is a shield unto them that put their trust in him” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/prov/30.5" class="scriptureRef">Prov. 30:5</a>).</p>

David asked if he could fight the man. The king refused, saying, “Thou art but a youth.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/1-sam/17.33" class="scriptureRef">1 Sam. 17:33</a>.)

His gun wavered from my stomach until its barrel pointed slightly to my left. My arm was already partly raised, and with a quick motion I could seize the gun and struggle with him without the likelihood of being shot. I was taller and heavier than this young man, and at that time of my life was somewhat athletic.

We had experienced the kind of miraculous protection illustrated in the Bible stories I had read as a boy.</p>

As a sign of that respect, we always addressed our bishop as “Bishop Christensen” or “Bishop Calder” or “Brother Jones.” We never called our bishop “Mr.” or by his first name, as we did in speaking to others. With the bishop, we always used an honored title.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/the-language-of-prayer.p2" pid="fLeiy8LAFESG4ZMgxQKh2g" hash="kicrfg">When I was seventeen, I joined the Utah National Guard. There I learned that a soldier must use certain words in speaking to an officer. I saw this as another mark of respect for authority. I also observed that this special language served as a way of reminding both the soldier and the officer of the responsibilities of their positions. I later understood that same reasoning as explaining why full-time missionaries should always be called by the dignified titles of <span class="emphasis">elder</span> or <span class="emphasis">sister,</span> or the equivalent in other languages.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/the-language-of-prayer.p3" pid="FmFspJmxmkGcY7lDX9Kp0w" hash="JJhAow">In my legal training I became familiar with the formal language lawyers use to address judges during court proceedings. After graduation I worked for a year as a law clerk to the chief justice of the United States. We always used the formal title of his office, Chief Justice. Similarly, communications to our most senior government leaders should be addressed in a particular way, such as Mr. President, Your Excellency, or Your Majesty. The use of titles signifies respect for office and authority.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/the-language-of-prayer.p4" pid="bzzAzYaRS0-5Ps-gac3nog" hash="QIwpQg">The words we use in speaking to someone can identify the nature of our relationship to that person. They can also remind speaker and listener of the responsibilities they owe one another in that relationship. The form of address can also serve as a mark of respect or affection.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/the-language-of-prayer.p5" pid="YN1xfIX8uEqJ3pojERxUNg" hash="RKewjw">So it is with the language of prayer. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches its members to use special language in addressing prayers to our Father in Heaven.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/the-language-of-prayer.p6" pid="v9I8OqcH80W33Lkpg6xN6A" hash="iYxOzQ">When we go to worship in a temple or a church, we put aside our working clothes and dress ourselves in something better. This change of clothing is a mark of respect. Similarly, when we address our Heavenly Father, we should put aside our working words and clothe our prayers in special language of reverence and respect. In offering prayers in the English language, members of our Church do not address our Heavenly Father with the same words we use in speaking to a fellow worker, to an employee or employer, or to a merchant in the marketplace. We use special words that have been sanctified by use in inspired communications, words that have been recommended to us and modeled for us by those we sustain as prophets and inspired teachers.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/the-language-of-prayer.p7" pid="b9nHlu70vkS8jYUr0gSdwQ" hash="-iVKCg">The special language of prayer follows different forms in different languages, but the principle is always the same. We should address prayers to our Heavenly Father in words which speakers of that language associate with love and respect and reverence and closeness. The application of this principle will, of course, vary according to the nature of a particular language, including the forms that were used when the scriptures were translated into that language. Some languages have intimate or familiar pronouns and verbs used only in addressing family and very close friends. Other languages have honorific forms of address that signify great respect, such as words used only when speaking to a king or other person of high rank. Both of these kinds of special words are appropriately used in offering prayers in other languages because they communicate the desired feelings of love, respect, reverence, or closeness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/the-language-of-prayer.p8" pid="kCLbhNJH8EmQiXr7HXvYWA" hash="owx4WQ">Modern English has no special verbs or pronouns that are intimate, familiar, or honorific. When we address prayers to our Heavenly Father in English, our only available alternatives are the common words of speech like <span class="emphasis">you</span> and <span class="emphasis">your</span> or the dignified but uncommon words like <span class="emphasis">thee, thou,</span> and <span class="emphasis">thy</span> which were used in the King James Version of the Bible almost five hundred years ago. Latter-day Saints, of course, prefer the latter. In our prayers we use language that is dignified and different, even archaic.</p>

It has been suggested that <span class="emphasis">thee, thou, thy,</span> and <span class="emphasis">thine</span> are simply holdovers from forms of address once used to signify respect for persons of higher rank. But more careful scholarship shows that the words we now use in the language of prayer were once commonly used by persons of rank in addressing persons of <span class="emphasis">inferior</span> position. These same English words were also used in communications between persons in an intimate relationship. There are many instances where usages of English words have changed over the centuries. But the history of English usage is not the point.</p>

In our day the English words <span class="emphasis">thee, thou, thy,</span> and <span class="emphasis">thine</span> are suitable for the language of prayer, not because of how they were used anciently but because they are currently obsolete in common English discourse. Being unused in everyday communications, they are now available as a distinctive form of address in English, appropriate to symbolize respect, closeness, and reverence for the one being addressed.</p>

We wish to follow the Savior’s teaching, “When ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/6.7" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 6:7</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/13.7" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 13:7</a>.)

It is not part of the teachings known and accepted by our brothers and sisters of other Christian and Jewish faiths. When leaders or members of other churches or synagogues phrase their prayers in the familiar forms of <span class="emphasis">you</span> or <span class="emphasis">your,</span> this does not signify a lack of reverence or respect in their belief and practice but only a preference for the more modern language. Significantly, this modern language is frequently the language used in the scriptural translations with which they are most familiar.</p>

When we called her name, she would usually answer by saying, “Here me is.” This childish reply was among the sweetest things her parents heard. But when she was grown, we expected her to use appropriate language when she spoke, and of course she did. As the Apostle Paul said, “When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13.11" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 13:11</a>.)</p>

Our earliest efforts will be heard with joy by our Heavenly Father, however they are phrased. They will be heard in the same way by loving members of our church. But as we gain experience as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we need to become more mature in all of our efforts, including our prayers.</p>

Persons spend many hours mastering communication skills in other mediums, such as poetry or prose, vocal or instrumental music, and even the language of access to computers. My brothers and sisters, the manner of addressing our Heavenly Father in prayer is at least as important as these.</p>

Norton, Jr., <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Jan. 1976, pp. 44–47.) The special language of prayer is even easier in most other languages.</p>

This requires parents to learn and pray with the special language of prayer. We learn our native language simply by listening to those who speak it. This is also true of the language with which we address our Heavenly Father. The language of prayer is easier and sweeter to learn than any other tongue. We should give our children the privilege of learning this language by listening to their parents use it in the various prayers offered daily in our homes.</p>

The special language of prayer reminds us of the greatness of that privilege. I pray that all of us will be more sensitive to the importance of using this reverent and loving language as we offer our public and private prayers.</p>

We were placed here on earth to progress toward our destiny of eternal life. These truths give us a unique perspective and different values to guide our decisions from those who doubt the existence of God and believe that life is the result of random processes.</p>

There the spirit children of God were taught his eternal plan for their destiny. We had progressed as far as we could without a physical body and an experience in mortality. To realize a fulness of joy, we had to prove our willingness to keep the commandments of God in a circumstance where we had no memory of what preceded our mortal birth.</p>

To reclaim us from death and sin, our Heavenly Father’s plan provided us a Savior, whose atonement would redeem all from death and pay the price necessary for all to be cleansed from sin on the conditions he prescribed (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.19-24" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 9:19–24</a>).</p>

This provides the opposition necessary to test how mortals will use their freedom to choose. Satan’s most strenuous opposition is directed at whatever is most important to the Father’s plan. Satan seeks to discredit the Savior and divine authority, to nullify the effects of the Atonement, to counterfeit revelation, to lead people away from the truth, to contradict individual accountability, to confuse gender, to undermine marriage, and to discourage childbearing (especially by parents who will raise children in righteousness).</p>

Modern revelation makes clear that what we call gender was part of our existence prior to our birth. God declares that he created “male and female” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.18" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:18</a>; <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/2.27" class="scriptureRef">Moses 2:27</a>; <a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/1.27" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 1:27</a>). Elder James E. Talmage explained: “The distinction between male and female is no condition peculiar to the relatively brief period of mortal life; it was an essential characteristic of our pre-existent condition” (<span class="emphasis">Millennial Star,</span> 24 Aug. 1922, p. 539).</p>

This commandment was first in sequence and first in importance. It was essential that God’s spirit children have mortal birth and an opportunity to progress toward eternal life. Consequently, all things related to procreation are prime targets for the adversary’s efforts to thwart the plan of God.</p>

This would be a planned offense, a formality to serve an eternal purpose. The Prophet Lehi explained that “if Adam had not transgressed he would not have fallen” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.22" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:22</a>), but would have remained in the same state in which he was created.</p>

Not the Latter-day Saints! Informed by revelation, we celebrate Eve’s act and honor her wisdom and courage in the great episode called the Fall (see Bruce R. McConkie, “Eve and the Fall,” <span class="emphasis">Woman,</span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1979, pp. 67–68). Joseph Smith taught that it was not a “sin,” because God had decreed it (see <span class="emphasis">The Words of Joseph Smith,</span> ed. Andrew F. Ehat and Lyndon W. Cook, Provo, Utah: Religious Studies Center, Brigham Young University, 1980, p. 63). Brigham Young declared, “We should never blame Mother Eve, not the least” (in <span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> 13:145). Elder Joseph Fielding Smith said: “I never speak of the part Eve took in this fall as a sin, nor do I accuse Adam of a sin. … This was a transgression of the law, but not a sin … for it was something that Adam and Eve had to do!” (Joseph Fielding Smith, <span class="emphasis">Doctrines of Salvation,</span> comp.

It also echoes a familiar distinction in the law. Some acts, like murder, are crimes because they are inherently wrong. Other acts, like operating without a license, are crimes only because they are legally prohibited. Under these distinctions, the act that produced the Fall was not a sin—inherently wrong—but a transgression—wrong because it was formally prohibited. These words are not always used to denote something different, but this distinction seems meaningful in the circumstances of the Fall.</p>

President Spencer W. Kimball taught that “in the context of lawful marriage, the intimacy of sexual relations is right and divinely approved. There is nothing unholy or degrading about sexuality in itself, for by that means men and women join in a process of creation and in an expression of love” (<span class="emphasis">The Teachings of Spencer W.

The Book of Mormon teaches that unchastity is “most abominable above all sins save it be the shedding of innocent blood or denying the Holy Ghost” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/39.5" class="scriptureRef">Alma 39:5</a>). In our own day, the First Presidency of the Church has declared the doctrine of this Church “that sexual sin—the illicit sexual relations of men and women—stands, in its enormity, next to murder” (“Message of the First Presidency,” 3 Oct. 1942, as quoted in <span class="emphasis">Messages of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,</span> comp. James R. Clark, 6 vols., Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1965–75, 6:176). Some who do not know the plan of salvation behave like promiscuous animals, but Latter-day Saints—especially those who are under sacred covenants—have no such latitude. We are solemnly responsible to God for the destruction or misuse of the creative powers he has placed within us.</p>

That is why abortion is such a serious sin. Our attitude toward abortion is not based on revealed knowledge of when mortal life begins for legal purposes. It is fixed by our knowledge that according to an eternal plan all of the spirit children of God must come to this earth for a glorious purpose, and that individual identity began long before conception and will continue for all the eternities to come. We rely on the prophets of God, who have told us that while there may be “rare” exceptions, “the practice of elective abortion is fundamentally contrary to the Lord’s injunction, ‘Thou shalt not … kill, nor do anything like unto it’ (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:6</a>)” (<span class="emphasis">1991 Supplement to the 1989 General Handbook of Instructions,</span> p. 1).</p>

In recent years strong economic pressures in many nations have altered the traditional assumption of a single breadwinner per family. Increases in the number of working mothers of young children inevitably signal a reduced commitment of parental time to nurturing the young. The effect of these reductions is evident in the rising numbers of abortions, divorces, child neglect, and juvenile crime.</p>

He said, “No man who is marriageable is fully living his religion who remains unmarried” (<span class="emphasis">Gospel Doctrine,</span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1939, p. 275).

When married couples postpone childbearing until after they have satisfied their material goals, the mere passage of time assures that they seriously reduce their potential to participate in furthering our Heavenly Father’s plan for all of his spirit children. Faithful Latter-day Saints cannot afford to look upon children as an interference with what the world calls “self-fulfillment.” Our covenants with God and the ultimate purpose of life are tied up in those little ones who reach for our time, our love, and our sacrifices.</p>

Of course, to care for children means more than simply giving them life. Children must be loved, nurtured, taught, fed, clothed, housed, and well started in their capacities to be good parents themselves. Exercising faith in God’s promises to bless them when they are keeping his commandments, many LDS parents have large families. Others seek but are not blessed with children or with the number of children they desire. In a matter as intimate as this, we should not judge one another.</p>

Sister Oaks and I are the parents of six, including four daughters. Our youngest daughter is still in her teens. As parents, we have learned a lot about teenage girls. I remember when one of our teenage daughters announced that she was in love with eight boys. She produced a list of their names. I made silent note of the fact that she had never even dated some of these boys, and one of them she had never even met. Within a few weeks she dropped several names off her list and added others. When I asked her how she could fall in love and out of love with so many boys so quickly, she wisely admitted, “I guess I’m not in love with those boys. I’m just in love with love.” Your parents and grandparents will remember the words of an old song, “Falling in love with love is falling for make believe” (Lorenz Hart, “Falling in Love with Love,” <span class="emphasis">The Boys from Syracuse,</span> n.p.: Chappell &amp; Co., 1938).</p>

If we think we have faith, we should ask, faith in whom or faith in what? For some, faith is nothing more than faith in themselves. That is only self-confidence or self-centeredness. Others have faith in faith, which is something like relying on the power of positive thinking or betting on the proposition that we can get what we want by manipulating the powers within us.</p>

That word, which comes to us by scripture, by prophetic teaching, and by personal revelation, teaches us that we are children of God, the Eternal Father. It teaches us about the identity and mission of Jesus Christ, his Only Begotten Son, our Savior and Redeemer. Founded on our knowledge of those things, faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is a conviction and trust that God knows us and loves us and will hear our prayers and answer them with what is best for us.</p>

He will do what is best for us and for all of our Heavenly Father’s children. The conviction that the Lord knows more than we do and that he will answer our prayers in the way that is best for us and for all of his other children is a vital ingredient of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. This important reality is beautifully described in an experience recorded in Elder John H.

That’s why we must always pray in faith, because we can’t have true, God-given faith in something that is not according to His will. If it’s according to His will, all parties will benefit. I learned to pray for a good wind and the ability to get there safely, not necessarily a tail wind” (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1993, p. 175).</p>

Remember how he prayed to the Father in the agony of Gethsemane? This was the culminating event of his life, the climactic fulfillment of his mission as our Savior. The gospel of Luke, as corrected in the inspired translation of the Prophet Joseph Smith, describes how he knelt down and prayed: “Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me; nevertheless, not my will, but thine be done” (<a href="/scriptures/jst/bible-jst-luke/22.42" class="scriptureRef">JST, Luke 22:42</a>).</p>

The Atonement had to be worked out by that lamb without blemish. But though the Son’s request was denied, his prayer was answered. The scripture records: “And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him” (<a href="/scriptures/jst/bible-jst-luke/22.43" class="scriptureRef">JST, Luke 22:43</a>).</p>

The exercise of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is always subject to the order of heaven, to the goodness and will and wisdom and timing of the Lord. That is why we cannot have true faith in the Lord without also having complete trust in the Lord’s will and in the Lord’s timing. When we have that kind of faith and trust in the Lord, we have true security in our lives. President Spencer W.

The tithe payers tended to keep their employment, enjoy good health, and be free from the most devastating effects of economic and spiritual depression (see <span class="emphasis">Church News,</span> 9 Dec. 1961, p. 16).

I have never forgotten her explanation: “Dallin, there might be some people who can get along without paying tithing, but we can’t. The Lord has chosen to take your father and leave me to raise you children. I cannot do that without the blessings of the Lord, and I obtain those blessings by paying an honest tithing.

I was a little boy at the time, and drove the team. When we drove up to the steps of the tithing office, ready to unload the potatoes, one of the clerks came out and said to my mother, ‘Widow Smith, it’s a shame that you should have to pay tithing.’ … He chided my mother for paying her tithing, called her anything but wise or prudent; and said there were others who were strong and able to work that were supported from the tithing office. My mother turned upon him and said: ‘William, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. Would you deny me a blessing? If I did not pay my tithing, I should expect the Lord to withhold His blessings from me. I pay my tithing, not only because it is a law of God, but because I expect a blessing by doing it. By keeping this and other laws, I expect to prosper and to be able to provide for my family’” (in Conference Report, Apr. 1900, p. 48).</p>

I warned that the Lord would withhold material and spiritual blessings when his covenant children were not keeping this vital commandment.</p>

The law of tithing and the promise of blessings to those who live it apply to the people of the Lord in every nation. I hope our members will qualify for the blessings of the Lord by paying a full tithing.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/tithing.p20" pid="gsPXUC9zZkar1bJzB3HWBQ" hash="8Wgz3w">Tithing is a commandment with a promise. The words of Malachi, reaffirmed by the Savior, promise those who bring their tithes into the storehouse that the Lord will open “the windows of heaven, and pour [them] out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.” The promised blessings are temporal and spiritual. The Lord promises to “rebuke the devourer,” and he also promises tithe payers that “all nations shall call you blessed, for ye shall be a delightsome land” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/24.10-12" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 24:10–12</a>; see <a href="/scriptures/ot/mal/3.10-12" class="scriptureRef">Mal. 3:10–12</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/tithing.p21" pid="oGNVPR0GPEuG43jIevgaSA" hash="P-ihoA">I believe these are promises to the nations in which we reside. When the people of God withheld their tithes and offerings, Malachi condemned “this whole nation” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/mal/3.9" class="scriptureRef">Mal. 3:9</a>). Similarly, I believe that when many citizens of a nation are faithful in the payment of tithes, they summon the blessings of heaven upon their entire nation. The Bible teaches that “righteousness exalteth a nation” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/prov/14.34" class="scriptureRef">Prov. 14:34</a>) and “a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/gal/5.9" class="scriptureRef">Gal. 5:9</a>; see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/13.33" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 13:33</a>).</p>

Tithe paying is evidence that we accept the law of sacrifice. It also prepares us for the law of consecration and the other higher laws of the celestial kingdom. The <span class="emphasis">Lectures on Faith,</span> prepared by the early leaders of the restored Church, part the curtain on that subject when they say:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/tithing.p23" pid="Pbhez4NnTEqBBDayq104Bg" hash="335Xsw">“Let us here observe that a religion that does not require the sacrifice of all things never has power sufficient to produce the faith necessary unto life and salvation; for, from the first existence of man, the faith necessary unto the enjoyment of life and salvation never could be obtained without the sacrifice of all earthly things” (<span class="emphasis">Lectures on Faith,</span> 6:7).</p>

Tithe paying is commanded in the Bible. Abraham paid tithes to Melchizedek (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/14.20" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 14:20</a>). Jacob covenanted to “give the tenth” unto God (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/28.22" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 28:22</a>). After the children of Israel were brought out of Egypt, the prophet Moses commanded that they should give a tenth to the Lord (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/lev/27.30-34" class="scriptureRef">Lev. 27:30–34</a>).</p>

The Savior replied with this command: “Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s; and unto God the things that are God’s” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/22.21" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 22:21</a>).</p>

None of the featured athletes was LDS. If the names of our tithe-paying LDS professional athletes had been added to the list, it would have been much longer.</p>

Shepherd, “Men Who Tithe,” <span class="emphasis">Improvement Era,</span> June 1928, pp. 633–45). BYU president Ernest L.

We do this by paying our tithing to our bishop or branch president. We do not pay tithing by contributing to our favorite charities. The contributions we should make to charities come from our own funds, not from the tithes we are commanded to pay to the storehouse of the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/tithing.p31" pid="hDI3eupBfUOOhm5H7uY8zQ" hash="Kggg9g">The Lord has directed by revelation that the expenditure of his tithes will be directed by his servants, the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, and the Presiding Bishopric (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/120.title" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 120</a>). Those funds are spent to build and maintain temples and houses of worship, to conduct our worldwide missionary work, to translate and publish scriptures, to provide resources to redeem the dead, to fund religious education, and to support other Church purposes selected by the designated servants of the Lord.</p>

I am sorry that our modern cash economy deprives parents of the wonderful teaching opportunities presented by the payment of tithing in kind. In a recent book, <span class="emphasis">Tongan Saints: Legacy of Faith,</span> the author quotes a Tongan bishop’s memories of one such example:</p>

I remember following him daily to his plantation. He would always point out to me the very best of his taro, bananas, or yams and say: ‘These will be for our tithing.’ His greatest care was given to these ‘chosen’ ones. During the harvest, I was often the one assigned to take our load of tithing to the branch president. I remember sitting on the family horse. Grandfather would lift onto its back a sack of fine taro which I balanced in front of me. Then with a very serious look in his eyes, he said to me, ‘Simi, be very careful because this is our tithing.’ From my grandfather I learned early in life that you give only your best to the Lord” (Eric B. Shumway, trans. and ed., <span class="emphasis">Tongan Saints: Legacy of Faith,</span> Laie, Hawaii: The Institute for Polynesian Studies, 1991, pp. 79–80).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/tithing.p34" pid="WBxOeVoEO02303U3MhmiZw" hash="2WuOqQ">I had a similar experience as a young boy on my grandparents’ farm. They taught me about tithing with examples of one egg or one bushel of peaches out of ten. Years later I used those same kinds of examples to try to teach the principles of tithing to our own children.</p>

Attempting to teach tithing to our young son, I explained the principle of a tenth and how it would apply to the eggs gathered in a chicken farm and the young calves or horses born in a breeding herd. When I finished what I was sure was a clear explanation, I wanted to test whether our seven-year-old had understood. I asked him to imagine that he was a farmer with a harvest of eggs and young animals. I supplied the figures and then asked our little boy what he would give to the bishop as tithing. He thought deeply for a moment and then said, “I would give him a very old horse.”</p>

But I have often thought of that little boy’s words as I have observed how some adult Church members relate to the law of tithing. I think we still have some whose attitude and performance consist of giving the bishop something like “a very old horse.”</p>

When the Lord’s Apostles meet in modern times, the singing of hymns is still part of their meetings. The weekly meetings of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in the Salt Lake Temple always begin with a hymn. Elder Russell M. Nelson plays the organ accompaniment. The First Presidency, who conduct these meetings, rotate the privilege of selecting the opening song. Most of us record the date each hymn is sung. According to my records, the opening song most frequently sung during the decade of my participation has been “I Need Thee Every Hour” (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> 1985, no. 98).

At temple dedications I have seen more tears of joy elicited by music than by the spoken word. I have read accounts of angelic choirs joining in these hymns of praise, and I think I have experienced this on several occasions. In dedicatory sessions featuring beautiful and well-trained choirs of about thirty voices, there are times when I have heard what seemed to be ten times thirty voices praising God with a quality and intensity of feeling that can be experienced but not explained. Some who are listening today will know what I mean.</p>

We can make selective use of other music that is in harmony with the spirit of our hymns, such as Charles Gounod’s marvelous “O Divine Redeemer,” sung at the funeral of President Ezra Taft Benson. But a hymnbook’s hymn is often the most inspiring and appropriate musical selection for a choir, a vocalist, or an instrumentalist (see Michael F.

I felt this a few months ago as I participated in a musical performance that was unique in my church experience. I had been invited to speak at the Great Basin LDS Deaf Conference, hosted by the Salt Lake Valley (Deaf) Ward of the Salt Lake Park Stake. Over three hundred deaf brothers and sisters were in attendance. The members of the stake presidency and I were almost the only adults in the congregation who could hear and who attempted to sing audibly. The rest of that large assembly sang with their hands. Hardly a lip moved, and hardly a sound was heard except the organ and four faint voices from the stand. In the audience, all hands moved in unison with the leader as the audience signed “The Spirit of God like a fire is burning!” (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> 1985, no. 2). As we sang together, the Spirit of the Lord descended upon us, and we were made ready for prayer. Our sacred music is a powerful preparation for prayer and gospel teaching.</p>

Music is an effective way to worship our Heavenly Father and his Son, Jesus Christ. We should use hymns when we need spiritual strength and inspiration.</p>

But we have differences, and those differences explain why we send missionaries to other Christians, why we build temples in addition to churches, and why our beliefs bring us such happiness and strength to deal with the challenges of life and death. I wish to speak about some of the important additions our doctrines make to the Christian faith. My subject is apostasy and restoration.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/apostasy-and-restoration.p2" pid="hV_7t8SOiEyDywPY1sa9aA" hash="_Rr6LA">Last year searchers discovered a Roman fort and city in the Sinai close to the Suez Canal. Though once a major city, its location had been covered by desert sands and its existence had been forgotten for hundreds of years (see “Remains of Roman Fortress Emerge from Sinai Desert,” <span class="emphasis">Deseret News,</span> 6 Oct. 1994, p. A20). Discoveries like this contradict the common assumption that knowledge increases with the passage of time. In fact, on some matters the general knowledge of mankind regresses as some important truths are distorted or ignored and eventually forgotten. For example, the American Indians were in many respects more successful at living in harmony with nature than our modern society. Similarly, modern artists and craftsmen have been unable to recapture some of the superior techniques and materials of the past, like the varnish on a Stradivarius violin.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/apostasy-and-restoration.p3" pid="ko2Q0n_FVkm0ZT2xJo6DSw" hash="ecLNmA">We would be wiser if we could restore the knowledge of some important things that have been distorted, ignored, or forgotten. This also applies to religious knowledge. It explains the need for the gospel restoration we proclaim.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/apostasy-and-restoration.p4" pid="s-db8MbWGUaQey_FXBNtCQ" hash="kToE9A">When Joseph Smith was asked to explain the major tenets of our faith, he wrote what we now call the Articles of Faith. The first article states, “We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.” The Prophet later declared that “the simple and first principles of the gospel” include knowing “for a certainty the character of God” (“Conference Minutes,” <span class="emphasis">Times and Seasons,</span> 15 Aug. 1844, p. 614). We must begin with the truth about God and our relationship to him. Everything else follows from that.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/apostasy-and-restoration.p5" pid="YWuBX1zDyEa4kN_MvhI7nw" hash="woxW9w">In common with the rest of Christianity, we believe in a Godhead of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. However, we testify that these three members of the Godhead are three separate and distinct beings. We also testify that God the Father is not just a spirit but is a glorified person with a tangible body, as is his resurrected Son, Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/apostasy-and-restoration.p6" pid="Dbqwx5Zvtk-NsdSFO2YZ1Q" hash="vtGHNg">When first communicated to mankind by prophets, the teachings we now have in the Bible were “plain and pure, and most precious and easy” to understand (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/14.23" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 14:23</a>). Even in the transmitted and translated version we have today, the Bible language confirms that God the Father and his resurrected Son, Jesus Christ, are tangible, separate beings. To cite only two of many such teachings, the Bible declares that man was created in the image of God, and it describes three separate members of the Godhead manifested at the baptism of Jesus (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/1.27" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 1:27</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/3.13-17" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 3:13–17</a>).</p>

They believe that God is a spirit and that the Godhead is only one God. In our view, these concepts are evidence of the falling away we call the Great Apostasy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/apostasy-and-restoration.p8" pid="m8oANpML1kepohEQNnL3Yw" hash="qNj0lw">We maintain that the concepts identified by such nonscriptural terms as “the incomprehensible mystery of God” and “the mystery of the Holy Trinity” are attributable to the ideas of Greek philosophy. These philosophical concepts transformed Christianity in the first few centuries following the deaths of the Apostles. For example, philosophers then maintained that physical matter was evil and that God was a spirit without feelings or passions. Persons of this persuasion, including learned men who became influential converts to Christianity, had a hard time accepting the simple teachings of early Christianity: an Only Begotten Son who said he was in the express image of his Father in Heaven and who taught his followers to be one as he and his Father were one, and a Messiah who died on a cross and later appeared to his followers as a resurrected being with flesh and bones.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/apostasy-and-restoration.p9" pid="gGcVoNZzJkCkxe8lKmaxMg" hash="BlBFiA">The collision between the speculative world of Greek philosophy and the simple, literal faith and practice of the earliest Christians produced sharp contentions that threatened to widen political divisions in the fragmenting Roman empire. This led Emperor Constantine to convene the first churchwide council in <small>A.D.</small> 325. The action of this council of Nicaea remains the most important single event after the death of the Apostles in formulating the modern Christian concept of deity. The Nicene Creed erased the idea of the separate being of Father and Son by defining God the Son as being of “one substance with the Father.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/apostasy-and-restoration.p10" pid="WDXbmruA8kqn20x7kHY4gw" hash="Fa54pQ">Other councils followed, and from their decisions and the writings of churchmen and philosophers there came a synthesis of Greek philosophy and Christian doctrine in which the orthodox Christians of that day lost the fulness of truth about the nature of God and the Godhead. The consequences persist in the various creeds of Christianity, which declare a Godhead of only one being and which describe that single being or God as “incomprehensible” and “without body, parts, or passions.” One of the distinguishing features of the doctrine of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is its rejection of all of these postbiblical creeds (see Stephen E. Robinson, <span class="emphasis">Are Mormons Christians?</span> Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1991; <span class="emphasis">Encyclopedia of Mormonism,</span> ed. Daniel H. Ludlow, 4 vols., New York: Macmillan Publishing Co., 1992, s.v. “Apostasy,” “doctrine,” “God the Father,” and “Godhead”).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/apostasy-and-restoration.p11" pid="kYYlmukfjkOI_G5UqzIZ6w" hash="H87x5g">In the process of what we call the Apostasy, the tangible, personal God described in the Old and New Testaments was replaced by the abstract, incomprehensible deity defined by compromise with the speculative principles of Greek philosophy. The received language of the Bible remained, but the so-called “hidden meanings” of scriptural words were now explained in the vocabulary of a philosophy alien to their origins. In the language of that philosophy, God the Father ceased to be a Father in any but an allegorical sense. He ceased to exist as a comprehensible and compassionate being. And the separate identity of his Only Begotten Son was swallowed up in a philosophical abstraction that attempted to define a common substance and an incomprehensible relationship.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/apostasy-and-restoration.p12" pid="D6t44QPQS0ulTz9r8uRLGQ" hash="_R7rmQ">These descriptions of a religious philosophy are surely undiplomatic, but I hasten to add that Latter-day Saints do not apply such criticism to the men and women who profess these beliefs. We believe that most religious leaders and followers are sincere believers who love God and understand and serve him to the best of their abilities. We are indebted to the men and women who kept the light of faith and learning alive through the centuries to the present day. We have only to contrast the lesser light that exists among peoples unfamiliar with the names of God and Jesus Christ to realize the great contribution made by Christian teachers through the ages. We honor them as servants of God.</p>

An unschooled boy, seeking knowledge from the ultimate source, saw two personages of indescribable brightness and glory and heard one of them say, while pointing to the other, “This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.17" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:17</a>.) The divine teaching in that vision began the restoration of the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ. God the Son told the boy prophet that all the “creeds” of the churches of that day “were an abomination in his sight” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.19" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:19</a>). We affirm that this divine declaration was a condemnation of the creeds, not of the faithful seekers who believed in them. Joseph Smith’s first vision showed that the prevailing concepts of the nature of God and the Godhead were untrue and could not lead their adherents to the destiny God desired for them.</p>

Nor do we equate our imperfect mortal bodies to his immortal, glorified being. But we can comprehend the fundamentals he has revealed about himself and the other members of the Godhead.

Joseph Smith and Brigham Young both taught that “no man … can know himself unless he knows God, and he can not know God unless he knows himself” (in<span class="emphasis"> Journal of Discourses,</span> 16:75; see also <span class="emphasis">The Words of Joseph Smith,</span> ed. Andrew F. Ehat and Lyndon W. Cook, Provo: Religious Studies Center, Brigham Young University, 1980, p. 340). The Bible describes mortals as “the children of God” and as “heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/8.16-17" class="scriptureRef">Rom. 8:16–17</a>). It also declares that “we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/8.17" class="scriptureRef">Rom. 8:17</a>) and that “when he shall appear, we shall be like him” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-jn/3.2" class="scriptureRef">1 Jn. 3:2</a>). We take these Bible teachings literally. We believe that the purpose of mortal life is to acquire a physical body and, through the atonement of Jesus Christ and by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel, to qualify for the glorified, resurrected celestial state that is called exaltation or eternal life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/apostasy-and-restoration.p17" pid="hnfNyZEOH02u9cF9PzrcRw" hash="1CKhHw">Like other Christians, we believe in a heaven or paradise and a hell following mortal life, but to us that two-part division of the righteous and the wicked is merely temporary, while the spirits of the dead await their resurrections and final judgments. The destinations that follow the final judgments are much more diverse. Our restored knowledge of the separateness of the three members of the Godhead provides a key to help us understand the diversities of resurrected glory.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/apostasy-and-restoration.p18" pid="vbb5s6iimk6MkYKj_I1gAQ" hash="4foUWw">In their final judgment, the children of God will be assigned to a kingdom of glory for which their obedience has qualified them. In his letters to the Corinthians, the Apostle Paul described these places. He told of a vision in which he was “caught up to the third heaven” and “heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-cor/12.2,4" class="scriptureRef">2 Cor. 12:2, 4</a>). Speaking of the resurrection of the dead, he described “celestial bodies,” “bodies terrestrial” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15.40" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 15:40</a>), and “bodies telestial” (JST, 1 Cor. 15:40), each pertaining to a different degree of glory. He likened these different glories to the sun, to the moon, and to different stars (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15.41" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 15:41</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/apostasy-and-restoration.p19" pid="hESM2sE_SUWjNtX_010KuA" hash="_ummlg">We learn from modern revelation that these three different degrees of glory have a special relationship to the three different members of the Godhead.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/apostasy-and-restoration.p20" pid="B6pecequaE-D6knkiGrNbw" hash="y95-Bw">The lowest degree is the telestial domain of those who “received not the gospel, neither the testimony of Jesus, neither the prophets” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.101" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 76:101</a>) and who have had to suffer for their wickedness. But even this degree has a glory that “surpasses all understanding” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.89" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 76:89</a>). Its occupants receive the Holy Spirit and the administering of angels, for even those who have been wicked will ultimately be “heirs of [this degree of] salvation” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.88" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 76:88</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/apostasy-and-restoration.p21" pid="xBxQJ1_hn0-KEj5-ycTE6w" hash="la1Ekg">The next higher degree of glory, the terrestrial, “excels in all things the glory of the telestial, even in glory, and in power, and in might, and in dominion” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.91" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 76:91</a>). The terrestrial is the abode of those who were the “honorable men of the earth” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.75" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 76:75</a>). Its most distinguishing feature is that those who qualify for terrestrial glory “receive of the presence of the Son” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.77" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 76:77</a>). Concepts familiar to all Christians might liken this higher kingdom to heaven because it has the presence of the Son.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/apostasy-and-restoration.p22" pid="NrcF8E3l-U2ZVKkmQmgAtQ" hash="Z1pDMg">In contrast to traditional Christianity, we join with Paul in affirming the existence of a third or higher heaven. Modern revelation describes it as the celestial kingdom—the abode of those “whose bodies are celestial, whose glory is that of the sun, even the glory of God” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.70" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 76:70</a>). Those who qualify for this kingdom of glory “shall dwell in the presence of God and his Christ forever and ever” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.62" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 76:62</a>). Those who have met the highest requirements for this kingdom, including faithfulness to covenants made in a temple of God and marriage for eternity, will be exalted to the godlike state referred to as the “fulness” of the Father or eternal life (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.56,94" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 76:56, 94</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/131.title" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 131</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.19-20" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 132:19–20</a>). (This destiny of eternal life or God’s life should be familiar to all who have studied the ancient Christian doctrine of and belief in deification or apotheosis.) For us, eternal life is not a mystical union with an incomprehensible spirit-god. Eternal life is family life with a loving Father in Heaven and with our progenitors and our posterity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/apostasy-and-restoration.p23" pid="Wjkz1KFNDEa4lmpaHK5pSQ" hash="daWyTg">The theology of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is comprehensive, universal, merciful, and true. Following the necessary experience of mortal life, all sons and daughters of God will ultimately be resurrected and go to a kingdom of glory. The righteous—regardless of current religious denomination or belief—will ultimately go to a kingdom of glory more wonderful than any of us can comprehend. Even the wicked, or almost all of them, will ultimately go to a marvelous—though lesser—kingdom of glory. All of that will occur because of God’s love for his children and because of the atonement and resurrection of Jesus Christ, “who glorifies the Father, and saves all the works of his hands” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.43" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 76:43</a>).</p>

This church exists to provide the sons and daughters of God with the means of entrance into and exaltation in the celestial kingdom. This is a family-centered church in doctrine and practices. Our understanding of the nature and purpose of God the Eternal Father explains our destiny and our relationship in his eternal family. Our theology begins with heavenly parents. Our highest aspiration is to be like them. Under the merciful plan of the Father, all of this is possible through the atonement of the Only Begotten of the Father, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. As earthly parents we participate in the gospel plan by providing mortal bodies for the spirit children of God. The fulness of eternal salvation is a family matter.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/apostasy-and-restoration.p25" pid="6lrm0PYvY0-RCqpGuOGg3w" hash="uSkOVQ">It is the reality of these glorious possibilities that causes us to proclaim our message of restored Christianity to all people, even to good practicing Christians with other beliefs. This is why we build temples. This is the faith that gives us strength and joy to confront the challenges of mortal life. We offer these truths and opportunities to all people and testify to their truthfulness in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/powerful-ideas.p1" pid="Yn37QRtWsUOZECJ33MMv-g" hash="uz7qMw">Last summer I attended the funeral of an elect lady. One speaker described three of her great qualities: loyalty, obedience, and faith. As he elaborated on her life, I thought how appropriate it was to speak of such powerful qualities in a funeral tribute. A life is not a trivial thing, and its passing should not be memorialized with trivial things. A funeral service is a time to speak of powerful ideas—ideas that can appropriately stand beside the importance of life, ideas that are powerful in their influence on those who remain behind.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/powerful-ideas.p2" pid="cHEHlN0D4kOvnugiYtro_w" hash="E9FMXQ">As I enjoyed the spirit of this inspiring funeral, my thoughts were directed toward the application of this principle in other settings. Parents should also teach powerful ideas. So should home teachers, visiting teachers, and the teachers in various classes. The Savior warned that we will be judged for “every idle word that [we] shall speak” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/12.36" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 12:36</a>). Modern revelation commands us to cease from “light speeches” and “light-mindedness” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.121" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:121</a>) and to cast away “idle thoughts” and “excess of laughter” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.69" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:69</a>). There are plenty of other spokesmen for trivial things. Latter-day Saints should be constantly concerned with teaching and emphasizing those great and powerful eternal truths that will help us find our way back to the presence of our Heavenly Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/powerful-ideas.p3" pid="zjDUXFvzpUyeQoEpIjiQow" hash="BpfivQ">About thirty years ago, some scholars authored a book on general education—the body of knowledge expected of all educated persons. Its title, <span class="emphasis">The Knowledge Most Worth Having,</span> (Wayne C. Booth, ed., Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press, 1967), is a good reminder of the fact that knowledge is not of equal value. Some knowledge is more important than others. That principle also applies to what we call spiritual knowledge.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/powerful-ideas.p4" pid="-xLo_Miz50uMgy5gfcz4RQ" hash="zd86lg">Consider the power of the idea taught in our beloved song “I Am a Child of God” (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> 1985, no. 301), sung so impressively by the choir at the beginning of this session. Here is the answer to one of life’s great questions, “Who am I?” I am a child of God with a spirit lineage to heavenly parents. That parentage defines our eternal potential. That powerful idea is a potent antidepressant. It can strengthen each of us to make righteous choices and to seek the best that is within us. Establish in the mind of a young person the powerful idea that he or she is a child of God and you have given self-respect and motivation to move against the problems of life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/powerful-ideas.p5" pid="clpVdrodFUKvzlWsEIQFzQ" hash="GEBBAw">When we understand our relationship to God, we also understand our relationship to one another. All men and women on this earth are the offspring of God, spirit brothers and sisters. What a powerful idea! No wonder God’s Only Begotten Son commanded us to love one another. If only we could do so! What a different world it would be if brotherly and sisterly love and unselfish assistance could transcend all boundaries of nation, creed, and color. Such love would not erase all differences of opinion and action, but it would encourage each of us to focus our opposition on actions rather than actors.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/powerful-ideas.p6" pid="mFsoK3D8LkKSyT5aH5WR6g" hash="86neCQ">The eternal truth that our Heavenly Father loves all his children is an immensely powerful idea. It is especially powerful when children can visualize it through the love and sacrifice of their earthly parents. Love is the most powerful force in the world. Arthur Henry King has said, “Love is not just an ecstasy, not just an intense feeling. It is a driving force. It is something that carries us through our life of joyful duty” (<span class="emphasis">The Abundance of the Heart,</span> Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1986, p. 84).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/powerful-ideas.p7" pid="OfqUHnTcvUyOoVjOnC98AA" hash="g7KF0Q">We all have our own examples of the power of love. More than twenty-five years ago I recorded some memories I had of my father, who died before I was eight years old. What I wrote then illustrates the power of love in the life of a boy:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/powerful-ideas.p8" pid="3Xh_P-PLJUW2ArXczH0X8g" hash="UA-yxQ">“The strongest impression I have of my relationship with my father I cannot document with any event or any words I can recall. It is a feeling. Based on words and actions long since lost to mind, this feeling persists with all the clarity of perfect faith. He loved me and he was proud of me. … That is the kind of memory a boy can treasure, and also a man” (“Memories of My Father,” 15 Oct. 1967).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/powerful-ideas.p9" pid="E9xeyAeiOUW0IGX79n84HQ" hash="ejp0dg">Another powerful idea we should teach one another is that mortal life has a purpose and that mortal death is not the end but only a transition to the next phase of an existence that is immortal. President Brigham Young taught that “our existence here is for the sole purpose of exaltation and restoration to the presence of our Father and God” (<span class="emphasis">Discourses of Brigham Young,</span> sel. John A. Widtsoe, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1978, p. 37). The idea of eternal progress is one of the most powerful ideas in our theology. It gives us hope when we falter and challenge when we soar. Surely this is one of the great “solemnities of eternity” that we are commanded to let “rest upon [our] minds” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/43.34" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 43:34</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/powerful-ideas.p10" pid="9qL2_wqNSkWA7T1DMid9eQ" hash="OMXKGA">Another idea that is powerful to lift us from discouragement is that the work of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, “to bring to pass the … eternal life of man” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:39</a>), is an eternal work. Not all problems are overcome and not all needed relationships are fixed in mortality. The work of salvation goes on beyond the veil of death, and we should not be too apprehensive about incompleteness within the limits of mortality.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/powerful-ideas.p11" pid="c-hjuOfHkU2bDEuIWiSkZA" hash="5CkC3w">A powerful idea with immediate practical application is the reality that we can pray to our Heavenly Father, and he will hear our prayers and help us in the way that is best for us. Most of us have experienced the terrible empty feeling that comes from being separated from those who love us. If we remember that we can pray and be heard and helped, we can always withstand that feeling of emptiness. We can always be in touch with a powerful friend who loves us and helps us, in his own time and in his own way.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/powerful-ideas.p12" pid="0w1xgwSwj0Ci8D1ptsAmOg" hash="IqtmqA">Thousands of experiences show that we can pray and have our prayers answered. Some of the choicest involve young children. In the biography of President Spencer W. Kimball we read:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/powerful-ideas.p13" pid="9wkg4IwCskekqMc627gnOg" hash="8VXFgA">“Again and again Spencer watched his parents take their problems to the Lord. One day when Spencer was five and out doing his chores, little one-year-old Fannie wandered from the house and was lost. No one could find her. Clare, sixteen, said, ‘Ma, if we pray, the Lord will direct us to Fannie.’ So the mother and children prayed. Immediately after the prayer Gordon walked to the very spot where Fannie was fast asleep in a large box behind the chicken coop. ‘We thanked our Heavenly Father over and over,’ Olive recorded in her journal” (Edward L. Kimball and Andrew E. Kimball, Jr., <span class="emphasis">Spencer W. Kimball,</span> Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1977, p. 31).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/powerful-ideas.p14" pid="OZ9TIo3uI0OAXkjPjFGC2Q" hash="_vI2fg">Every follower of Jesus Christ knows that the most powerful ideas of the Christian faith are the resurrection and the atonement of Jesus Christ. Because of him we can be forgiven of our sins and we will live again. Those powerful ideas have been explained in countless sermons from this pulpit and a million others. They are well known but not well applied in the lives of most of us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/powerful-ideas.p15" pid="qKmN1XDAL0iYk5W_YFP7og" hash="keDU4Q">Our model is not the latest popular hero of sports or entertainment, not our accumulated property or prestige, and not the expensive toys and diversions that encourage us to concentrate on what is temporary and forget what is eternal. Our model—our first priority—is Jesus Christ. We must testify of him and teach one another how we can apply his teachings and his example in our lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/powerful-ideas.p16" pid="dlcQtKSJUUOBr5p6wjeRrg" hash="sZ87iQ">Brigham Young gave us some practical advice on how to do this. “The difference between God and the Devil,” he said, “is that God creates and organizes, while the whole study of the Devil is to destroy” (<span class="emphasis">Discourses of Brigham Young,</span> p. 69). In that contrast we have an important example of the reality of “opposition in all things” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.11" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:11</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/powerful-ideas.p17" pid="49YAWqnwuECbholP1Elm6w" hash="-JIyrg">Remember, our Savior, Jesus Christ, always builds us up and never tears us down. We should apply the power of that example in the ways we use our time, including our recreation and diversions. Consider the themes of the books, magazines, movies, television, and music we make popular by our patronage. Do the purposes and actions portrayed in our chosen entertainment build up or tear down the children of God? During my lifetime I have seen a strong trend to displace what builds up and dignifies the children of God with portrayals and performances that are depressing, demeaning, and destructive.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/powerful-ideas.p18" pid="I7W4l7fILUWR4afmCAnYSw" hash="IgGGHw">The powerful idea in this example is that whatever builds people up serves the cause of the Master, and whatever tears people down serves the cause of the adversary. We support one cause or the other every day by our patronage. This should remind us of our responsibility and motivate us toward fulfilling it in a way that would be pleasing to Him whose suffering offers us hope and whose example should give us direction.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/powerful-ideas.p19" pid="VPlMrY4DzE2u2q2fHM7VmA" hash="4sA56A">We should always put the Savior first. The first commandment Jehovah gave to the children of Israel was, “Thou shalt have no other gods before me” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/20.3" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 20:3</a>). This seems like a simple idea, but in practice many find it difficult.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/powerful-ideas.p20" pid="3d801hAl9UaZaOwgCz9zjA" hash="pewTdQ">It is surprisingly easy to take what should be our first devotion and subordinate it to other priorities. Fifty years ago, the Christian philosopher C. S. Lewis illustrated that tendency with an example that is distressingly applicable in our own day. In his book <span class="emphasis">The Screwtape Letters,</span> a senior devil explains how to corrupt Christians and frustrate the work of Jesus Christ. One letter explains how any “extreme devotion” can lead Christians away from the Lord and the practice of Christianity. Lewis gives two examples, extreme patriotism or extreme pacifism, and explains how either “extreme devotion” can corrupt its adherent.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/powerful-ideas.p21" pid="0WPxmBsy6kOPuwgTeMASmg" hash="1pKxtg">“Let him begin by treating the Patriotism or the Pacifism as a part of his religion. Then let him, under the influence of partisan spirit, come to regard it as the most important part. Then quietly and gradually nurse him on to the stage at which the religion becomes merely part of the ‘cause,’ in which Christianity is valued chiefly because of the excellent arguments it can produce in favour of the British war effort or of pacifism. … Once you have made the World an end, and faith a means, you have almost won your man, and it makes very little difference what kind of worldly end he is pursuing” (C. S. Lewis, <span class="emphasis">The Screwtape Letters,</span> rev. ed., New York: MacMillan, 1982, p. 35).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/powerful-ideas.p22" pid="lrusQk0BokeogXsac091Mw" hash="Gn6S3Q">We can readily see that tendency in our own time, with many causes that are good in themselves but become spiritually corrupting when they assume priorities ahead of him who commanded, “Thou shalt have no other gods before me.” Jesus Christ and his work come first. Anything that would use him or his kingdom or his church as a means to an end serves the cause of the adversary.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/powerful-ideas.p23" pid="bpmcSuyZNkKI1tP3f_Nv0A" hash="3qxXRw">Two other powerful ideas were given voice by a noble young woman who survived a terrible experience. Virginia Reed was a survivor of the tragic Donner-Reed party, who made one of the earliest wagon treks into California. If this wagon train had followed the established Oregon Trail from Fort Bridger (Wyoming) northwest to Fort Hall (Idaho) and then southwest toward California, they would have reached their destination in safety. Instead, they were misled by a promoter. Lansford W. Hastings persuaded them they could save significant distance and time by following his so-called Hastings Cutoff. The Donner-Reed party left the proven trail at Fort Bridger and struggled southwest. They blazed a trail through the rugged Wasatch Mountains and then south of the Great Salt Lake and westward over the soggy surface of the salt flats in furnace heat.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/powerful-ideas.p24" pid="umwDhCsmj06dILYOprh96g" hash="daLITQ">The delays and incredible energies expended on this unproven route cost the Donner-Reed party an extra month in reaching the Sierra Nevada Mountains. As they hastened up the eastern slope trying to beat the first snows, they were caught in a tragic winter storm only one day short of the summit and a downhill passage into California. Marooned for the winter, half their group perished from starvation and cold.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/powerful-ideas.p25" pid="Mk7SEpnNlE6ZTdHcZEuhdg" hash="mq6ggQ">After months in the mountains and incredible hardships of hunger and terror, thirteen-year-old Virginia Reed reached California and sent a letter to her cousin in the Midwest. After recounting her experiences and the terrible sufferings of their party, she concluded with this wise advice: “Never take no cutofs and hury along as fast as you can” (Letter from Virginia E. B. Reed to her cousin Mary Gillespie, 16 May 1847, quoted in J. Roderic Korns and Dale L. Morgan, eds., <span class="emphasis">West from Fort Bridger,</span> Logan, Utah: Utah State University Press, 1994, p. 238).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/powerful-ideas.p26" pid="BwOXoxRwKEiY15fndBitsw" hash="caCNOQ">That is powerful and true advice, especially for teenagers. Young people are surrounded by many beckoning paths and many persuasive promoters who offer advice and cutoffs as substitutes for the proven way. “Try out this detour” or “tarry here for a while” are familiar proposals on the journey of life. My young friends, remember Virginia Reed’s advice—“Never take no cutofs and hury along as fast as you can.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/powerful-ideas.p27" pid="PuISX8yvR069uvYIlD_gVQ" hash="p9zFgg">I conclude with an example from the life of the Apostle Paul. During his ministry he was exposed to ample light-mindedness, idle thoughts, and trivial things. In Athens he observed that “all the Athenians and strangers which were there [in the market] spent their time in nothing else, but … to tell, or to hear some new thing” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/17.21" class="scriptureRef">Acts 17:21</a>). Paul’s determination to focus on powerful ideas is evident in one of his letters to the Saints in Corinth. He had not come “with excellency of speech or of wisdom,” he reminded them. “For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2.1-2" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 2:1–2</a>).</p>

Let us focus our teachings on those great and powerful ideas that have eternal significance in promoting righteousness, building up the children of God, and helping each of us toward our destiny of eternal life. That we may do so is my fervent prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

After I graduated from law school, I carefully read all seven volumes. I also pursued personal research in original records in Illinois, where the prophet Joseph lived the last five years of his life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/joseph-the-man-and-the-prophet.p3" pid="oz3vfnonM02uwaL7A_fo8w" hash="iqWgTg">The man I came to know in this way was not the man I had imagined. When I was a boy, growing up in the Church, I imagined the Prophet Joseph to be old and dignified and distant. But the Joseph Smith I met in my reading and personal research was a man of the frontier—young, emotional, dynamic, and so loved and approachable by his people that they often called him “Brother Joseph.” My studies strengthened my testimony of his prophetic calling. What a remarkable man! At the same time, I could see that he was mortal and therefore subject to sin and error, pain and affliction.</p>

He was 14 at the First Vision and 17 at the first visit from the angel Moroni. He was 21 when he received the golden plates and just 23 when he finished translating the Book of Mormon (in less than 60 working days). Over half of the revelations in our Doctrine and Covenants were given through the Prophet while he was 25 or younger. He was 26 when the First Presidency was organized and 30 when the Kirtland Temple was dedicated. He was just over 33 when he escaped his imprisonment in Missouri and resumed leadership of the Saints gathering in Nauvoo. He was 38 1/2 when he was martyred.</p>

When he was about seven, he suffered an excruciatingly painful surgery. Pieces of bone in his leg were chipped away without anesthetic. He was on crutches most of the next three years. Because of the poverty of his family, he had little formal education and as a youth was compelled to work long hours to help put food on the family table. The first three children of Joseph and his beloved Emma died at birth. A later child also died at birth and another in early childhood. Only four of Joseph and Emma’s nine birth children survived childhood. They also adopted twins, and one of these died as an infant.</p>

He was often hounded by false charges. He was almost continually on the edge of financial distress. In the midst of trying to fulfill the staggering responsibilities of his sacred calling, he had to labor as a farmer or merchant to provide a living for his family. He did this without the remarkable spiritual gifts that sustained him in his prophetic calling. The Lord had advised him that “in temporal labors thou shalt not have strength, for this is not thy calling” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/24.9" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 24:9</a>).</p>

The first 116 manuscript pages of the Book of Mormon translation were lost because 22-year-old Joseph yielded to entreaties and loaned them to Martin Harris. “Behold,” the Lord declared, “how oft you have transgressed the commandments and the laws of God, and have gone on in the persuasions of men” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/3.6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 3:6</a>). The Lord told Joseph to repent or he would be stripped of his prophetic role. Four later revelations, also published by the Prophet, command him to “repent and walk more uprightly” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/5.21" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 5:21</a>), speak of his having “sinned” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/64.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 64:7</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/90.1" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 90:1</a>), and rebuke him for not keeping the commandments (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.47" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 93:47</a>).</p>

He learned from heavenly messengers and from the harvest of his unique spiritual gifts. He had to rely on associates who had no role models either. They struggled and learned together, and the Prophet’s growth was extremely rapid.</p>

He cautioned a group of Saints newly arrived in Nauvoo against the tendency to be dissatisfied if everything was not done perfectly right. “He said he was but a man and they must not expect him to be perfect,” an associate recorded. “If they expected perfection from him, he should expect it from them, but if they would bear with his infirmities and the infirmities of the brethren, he would likewise bear with their infirmities” (<span class="emphasis">The Papers of Joseph Smith, Volume 2, Journal, 1832–1842,</span> ed. Dean C. Jessee [1992], 489).</p>

He delighted in the society of his friends. “He would play with the people,” one acquaintance recalled, “and he was always cheerful and happy” (Rachel Ridgeway Grant, “Joseph Smith, the Prophet,” <span class="emphasis">Young Woman’s Journal</span> 16 [Dec. 1905]: 551). He loved little children and often frolicked with them in a manner shocking to some accustomed to the exaggerated sobriety of other ministers. These warm, human qualities caused some to deny Joseph’s prophetic role, but they endeared him to many who knew him. Our records contain numerous adoring tributes like that of an acquaintance who said, “The love the saints had for him was inexpressible” (Mary Alice Cannon Lambert, <span class="emphasis">Young Woman’s Journal,</span> 16:554).</p>

During a meeting to consider disciplining a man who had rejected the counsel of the Presidency and the Twelve, he declared: “The Saints need not think because I am familiar with them and am playful and cheerful, that I am ignorant of what is going on. Iniquity of any kind cannot be sustained in the Church, and it will not fare well where I am; for I am determined while I do lead the Church, to lead it right” <span class="emphasis">(History of the Church,</span> 5:411). On another occasion he wrote, “I am a lover of the cause of Christ and of virtue chastity and an upright steady course of conduct &amp; a holy walk, I despise a hypocrite or a covenant breaker” (<span class="emphasis">The Personal Writings of Joseph Smith,</span> ed. Dean C. Jessee [1984], 246).</p>

He was a large man, strong and physically active. He delighted in competitive sports, including pulling sticks—a test of physical strength (see <span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 5:302). Our archives contain many recollections of his wrestling with friends and acquaintances. On one Sabbath, he and Brigham Young preached to the Saints in Ramus, Illinois, about a day’s ride from Nauvoo. On Monday, before departing Ramus, Joseph matched his wrestling prowess against a man someone described as “the bully of Ramus” (see Joseph Smith Journal, 13 March 1843, recorded by Willard Richards, Joseph Smith Collection, LDS Church Archives). Joseph threw him. I am glad our current conference schedules do not provide the local members opportunity to test the visiting authorities in this manner.</p>

Once he was kidnapped by two men who held cocked pistols to his head and repeatedly threatened to shoot him if he moved a muscle. The Prophet endured these threats for a time and then snapped back, “Shoot away; I have endured so much persecution and oppression that I am sick of life; why then don’t you shoot, and have done with it, instead of talking so much about it?” (in<span class="emphasis"> Journal of Discourses,</span> 2:167; see also <span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 5:440).</p>

During a public sermon in Nauvoo, he declared:</p>

Although I was called of my Heavenly Father to lay the foundation of this great work and kingdom in this dispensation, and testify of His revealed will to scattered Israel, I am subject to like passions as other men, like the prophets of olden times” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 5:516).</p>

Mormon historians—including Elder B. H. Roberts—had conceded that this action was illegal, but as a young law professor pursuing original research, I was pleased to find a legal basis for this action in the Illinois law of 1844. The amendment to the United States Constitution that extended the guarantee of freedom of the press to protect against the actions of city and state governments was not adopted until 1868, and it was not enforced as a matter of federal law until 1931. (See Dallin H. Oaks, “The Suppression of the <span class="emphasis">Nauvoo Expositor,</span>” <span class="emphasis">Utah Law Review</span> 9 [1965]: 862.) We should judge the actions of our predecessors on the basis of the laws and commandments and circumstances of their day, not ours.</p>

Hill and I were intrigued with the little-known fact that five men went to trial in Illinois for the murders of Joseph and Hyrum Smith. For over 10 years we scoured libraries and archives across the nation to find every scrap of information about this trial and those involved in it. We studied the actions and words of Illinois citizens who knew Joseph Smith personally, some who hated him and plotted to kill him, and others who loved him and risked their lives to witness the trial of his accused assassins. Nothing in our discoveries in the original court records or in the testimony at the lengthy trial disclosed anything that reflected dishonor on the men who were murdered. (See Dallin H. Oaks and Marvin S. Hill, <span class="emphasis">Carthage Conspiracy</span> [1975].)</p>

Joseph I. Bentley, then a law student at Chicago, and I discovered numerous records showing the business activities of Joseph Smith. As we explained in our article, this was a period following a nationwide financial panic and depression. Economic conditions in frontier states like Illinois were ruinous. The biographers of an Illinois contemporary, Abraham Lincoln, have described his financial embarrassments during this decade, when business was precarious, many obligations were in default, and lawsuits were common. The enemies of Joseph charged him with fraud in various property conveyances, mostly in behalf of the Church. A succession of court proceedings that extended for nearly a decade examined these claims in meticulous detail. Finally, in 1852, long after the Saints’ exodus from Illinois (so there was no conceivable political or other cause for anyone to favor the Prophet), a federal judge concluded this litigation with a decree that found no fraud or other moral impropriety by the Prophet. (See Dallin H. Oaks and Joseph I. Bentley, “Joseph Smith and Legal Process: In the Wake of the Steamboat <span class="emphasis">Nauvoo,</span>” <span class="emphasis">BYU Law Review</span> [1976]: 735.) Independent of that decree, as one who has examined the hundreds of pages of allegations and evidence in these proceedings, I testify to the Prophet’s innocence of the charges against him.</p>

Bad legal advice may have been one of the causes for Brigham Young’s well-publicized negative opinions of lawyers. I have often chuckled at his 1846 declaration that he “would rather have a six-shooter than all the lawyers in Illinois” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 7:386).</p>

His brother Hyrum chose to die at his side. John Taylor, also with him when he was murdered, said: “I testify before God, angels, and men, that he was a good, honorable, virtuous man … —that his private and public character was unimpeachable—and that he lived and died as a man of God” (<span class="emphasis">The Gospel Kingdom,</span> [1987], 355; see also <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/135.3" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 135:3</a>). Brigham Young declared: “I do not think that a man lives on the earth that knew [Joseph Smith] any better than I did; and I am bold to say that, Jesus Christ excepted, no better man ever lived or does live upon this earth” (in <span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> 9:332).</p>

As we partake of the sacrament each week, we ponder the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ and we reaffirm and renew the covenants we made when we were baptized. These acts of worship and commitment are described in the revealed prayer the priest offers upon the bread. As stated in that prayer, we partake of the bread “in remembrance of the body” of our Savior, and by doing so we witness to God, the Eternal Father, “that [we] are willing to take upon [us] the name of [his] Son, and always remember him and keep his commandments which he has given [us]” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.77" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:77</a>).</p>

When we consciously and sincerely renew our baptismal covenants as we partake of the sacrament, we renew our qualification for the promise “that [we] may always have his Spirit to be with [us]” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.77" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:77</a>).</p>

President Wilford Woodruff called the gift of the Holy Ghost the greatest gift we can receive in mortality (see<span class="emphasis"> The Discourses of Wilford Woodruff,</span> ed. G. Homer Durham [1990], 5). Unfortunately, the great value of that gift and the important conditions for its fulfillment are not well understood. Nephi prophesied that in the last days churches would be built up that would “teach with their learning, and deny the Holy Ghost, which giveth utterance” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.4" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 28:4</a>). He also pronounced “wo” upon “him that hearkeneth unto the precepts of men, and denieth the power of God, and the gift of the Holy Ghost!” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.26" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 28:26</a>).</p>

Earlier, he had taught them the mission of this comforter, which is otherwise referred to as the Holy Ghost, the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of the Lord, or simply the Spirit. That comforter dwells in us (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.17" class="scriptureRef">John 14:17</a>). He teaches us all things and brings all things to our remembrance (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.26" class="scriptureRef">John 14:26</a>). He guides us into truth and shows us things to come (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/16.13" class="scriptureRef">John 16:13</a>). He testifies of the Son (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/15.26" class="scriptureRef">John 15:26</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12.3" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 12:3</a>). The Bible also teaches that the Savior and his servants will baptize with the Holy Ghost and with fire (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/3.11" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 3:11</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/1.8" class="scriptureRef">Mark 1:8</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/1.33" class="scriptureRef">John 1:33</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/1.5" class="scriptureRef">Acts 1:5</a>).

The Holy Ghost is the means by which God inspires and reveals his will to his children (e.g., <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/8.2-3" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 8:2–3</a>). The Holy Ghost bears record of the Father and of the Son (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/28.11" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 28:11</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.27" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:27</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.17" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 42:17</a>). He enlightens our minds and fills us with joy (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/11.13" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 11:13</a>). By the power of the Holy Ghost we may know the truth of all things (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.5" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 10:5</a>). By his power we may have the mysteries of God unfolded to us (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/10.19" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 10:19</a>), all things which are expedient (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/18.18" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 18:18</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/39.6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 39:6</a>). The Holy Ghost shows us what we should do (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/32.5" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 32:5</a>). We teach the gospel as we are directed by the Holy Ghost, which carries our words into the hearts of those we teach (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/33.1" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 33:1</a>).</p>

Joseph Smith had journeyed to Washington to seek help in recovering compensation for injuries and losses the Saints had suffered in the Missouri persecutions.

The Prophet replied that “we differed in mode of baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 4:42).

This manifestation is given to acquaint sincere seekers with the truth about the Lord and his gospel.

When she received the added light of the restored gospel, she was baptized and the elders placed their hands upon her head and gave her the gift of the Holy Ghost. She recalled, “I felt the influence of the Holy Ghost settle upon me with greater intensity than I had ever felt before.

For example, that good feeling you have felt during the messages and music of this conference is a confirming witness of the Spirit, available to faithful members on a continuing basis. A member once asked me why he felt so good about the talks and music in a sacrament meeting, while a guest he had invited that day apparently experienced no such feeling. This is but one illustration of the contrast between one who has the gift of the Holy Ghost and is in tune with his promptings and one who has not, or is not.</p>

This sister was the only daughter of a wonderful mother, then about 80, whom she visited and helped each week. Though somewhat dependent physically, this mother was strong spiritually. She had served four missions and 15 years as a temple worker. Because she was in tune with the Spirit, she had a remarkable experience. Several months before this interview she told her daughter that the Spirit had whispered that her daughter’s husband would be called as a mission president.

Out of the seemingly small act of consciously and reverently renewing our baptismal covenants comes a renewal of the blessings of baptism by water and by the Spirit, that we may always have his Spirit to be with us. In this way all of us will be guided, and in this way all of us can be cleansed. That we may qualify for these precious blessings is my humble prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

During a sacrament meeting, a little boy made a big disturbance. After several minutes of trying to quiet this noisy three-year-old, the mother desperately handed him to the father, who was seated on the aisle close to the front of the chapel. By this time the noise distracted the speaker and audience, and everyone was very conscious of the parents’ plight. The father’s patience was much shorter than the mother’s. In a few moments he put the little boy over his shoulder, stood up, and started for the back door. Looking back over his father’s shoulder and sensing his determined steps, the little boy became quiet and apprehensive. Just as the father approached the rear door of the chapel, the little fellow reached his arms out toward the stand and shouted, “Bishop, help!”</p>

Assisted in all of this by his counselors, he is responsible for sacrament meeting and for the teaching of the gospel in all classes in the ward. The bishopric also directs all of the other meetings of the ward, including the priesthood executive committee and the ward council.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/bishop-help.p5" pid="Y-0Jl6ohgkO1k3wXQqIuEg" hash="76KZdg">The bishopric is also responsible for monitoring the Church service time of all ward members serving under their direction. Knowing the circumstances of the ward, they determine the appropriate balance of ward meetings and activities and the time remaining for families. They are also conscious of the purpose of our Sunday consolidated meeting schedule, which was not established to give time for more Sabbath meetings but to allow increased time for families to be together and for individual gospel study and service.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/bishop-help.p6" pid="A_aq0ScixESG9arSmK9-Kw" hash="6s0UPQ">The bishopric (or branch presidency) is also in charge of unit finances. They receive tithes and offerings, oversee the unit budget and expenditures, remit funds, and see that records are properly kept. The bishop is the judge who determines how Church commodities and funds are used to provide for the temporal needs of the members. He is also responsible for seeking out the poor and the needy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/bishop-help.p7" pid="4MvmxMDP0k2JEOgKRbd6CQ" hash="rlDILg">The bishop is the judge and the shepherd who has the power of discernment and the right to revelation and inspiration for the guidance of the flock. He is responsible for holding worthiness interviews in order to authorize attendance at the temple, callings to ward positions, ordinations to priesthood offices, and the callings of missionaries. He administers formal and informal discipline for violation of the laws of the Church, and he counsels and helps members avoid the necessity for discipline.</p>

A bishop needs to be a skillful delegator, or he will be crushed under the burden of his responsibilities or frustrated at seeing so many of them unfilled.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/bishop-help.p9" pid="fGZq644O-USWkfyD2qnVpQ" hash="ft3n3g">I marvel at the work of our bishops and branch presidents. In my lifetime, our family has had many bishops. We have loved each of them and their counselors, and we have felt their love and assistance in our lives. Each of them was different in his personality, but each was a devoted servant of the Lord. I have seen the mantle of responsibility increase their stature, and I have rejoiced in their magnificent service to the people. God bless the bishops and bishoprics of this Church!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/bishop-help.p10" pid="7y7alny6N06omxQ3THPxwA" hash="gqQZSg">There is something else we should mention about bishops. They are not specialists. We do not have bishops whose sole attentions are directed toward the youth, the aged, the married, the abused, or any particular occupational or ethnic group. Under the revelations of the Lord and the directions of His prophets, a bishop is ordained and set apart to preside over a ward whose boundaries are geographic and whose membership includes all who reside there. For this reason, a bishop looks after the old and the young, the married and the single, the rich and the poor, the active and the less active. In this he seeks to unify the flock so that we may be taught and serve in groups of Saints that transcend considerations of age, marital status, ancestry, and economic condition. Our bishops lead us all in our efforts to follow the Savior’s commandment to “be one; and if ye are not one ye are not mine” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38.27" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 38:27</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/bishop-help.p11" pid="1nFIuszYqEGekShVTH12-w" hash="Qp4LIQ">The Lord told the early members of His Church that the voice of His servants is the voice of the Lord, and that the hand of His servants is the hand of the Lord (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.38" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:38</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/36.2" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 36:2</a>). I testify to the truthfulness of that principle, which imposes a solemn duty upon the members of this Church to be loyal to their leaders and faithful in following their direction. I affirm that the Lord will bless us for doing so. That principle also imposes a great responsibility on the holders of office in this Church. Leaders must assure that they exercise their sacred authority “by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.41" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:41</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/bishop-help.p12" pid="HeBjRvoTcke2knsvN_nOCQ" hash="RCgVSA">We now have over 15,000 bishops and over 8,000 branch presidents in this Church. When we count their counselors, the total serving in bishoprics and branch presidencies is over 65,000. We praise and honor these worthy shepherds of the flock, judges in Israel, leaders and teachers of the people, men who love and are loved by those whom they serve as undershepherds of the Lord Jesus Christ. God bless these good men! And God bless their faithful wives, whose loyalty and support make their service possible.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/bishop-help.p13" pid="_Y6arDr9oUC10e2Gf8ZlKA" hash="PGIkXw">As I began this talk, I quoted the words of a three-year-old who called, “Bishop, help!” I will now reverse those words and make them a challenge for each of us: “Help [the] bishop!”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/bishop-help.p14" pid="W3kN90wXEEiCQS_vnKSgMQ" hash="TUBjPQ">Our current circumstances are different from those experienced by bishops and their counselors and members in earlier times. Today we have local leaders in most parts of the world. Many geographic wards and branches are in large cities and include hundreds of thousands or even millions of people. Some bishops travel during the week or commute long hours and great distances to work, effectively isolated from their families and their members for most of the hours of the week. Nevertheless, we also have communication and transportation resources undreamed of in earlier times. Whatever the physical changes over time, the nature of our local leaders’ callings has not changed, nor has their compensation. They are totally uncompensated by the coin of mortality. For the reward of their labors, all rely on the Lord’s deferred compensation plan.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/bishop-help.p15" pid="1ChIPkWLDU-7jfKsqXbA8g" hash="HQ3juA">Unchanged also is the fact that as they struggle with the heavy duties of their callings, bishops and their counselors must also earn a living and fulfill other family responsibilities. They do this not only because of their love for their wife and children, but also because they are responsible for being role models for the members of their flock. The burden is a heavy one that cannot be fulfilled without the supportive efforts of ward officers and members.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/bishop-help.p16" pid="piKhc47XtkykjjPAXf1sIw" hash="cm8ODg">How do we help? To lighten the load of the bishopric, auxiliary presidencies and Melchizedek Priesthood quorum presidencies and group leaders need to exercise initiative and fully function in the great responsibilities of their callings. Bishops are responsible to call; they should not be required to beg or push. All of us should accept the callings we are given and serve in all diligence. The most common calling received for men is home teacher and for women is Relief Society visiting teacher. When properly performed, these vital callings can substantially lighten the load of the bishopric. Home teachers and visiting teachers are the eyes and ears and hands of the bishop. Brothers and sisters, help the bishop and his counselors by reliable, faithful performance of your visits and oversight as home teachers and visiting teachers.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/bishop-help.p17" pid="AVEIVqv5K0CM-JYFelgwow" hash="1FSASQ">Each of us should do all that we can, in the spirit of gospel self-reliance, to provide for ourselves and our families in a temporal and a spiritual way. Then, if it is necessary to reach out for help, we know we have first done all that we can. This includes helping the members of our immediate and extended families to the maximum extent possible so that the bishop is not faced with burdens that should be handled in the first instance by the individual or by the extended family.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/bishop-help.p18" pid="SclPl4kKVk-0zq_4SDoPJg" hash="uLKASg">Another way to help our busy bishops and their counselors is to be careful not to occupy their time with matters that others can handle. If we need an address or a phone number or help with some other routine task, we should not call a member of the bishopric. Let us reserve their time for the heavy responsibilities that are uniquely theirs. Let us call on others for the things others can handle.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/bishop-help.p19" pid="CsS1efdZdEeix5ezvYYkug" hash="BdTPjA">When contacting our local leaders <span class="emphasis">is</span> necessary, we should remember that they have employment responsibilities too. Don’t contact them at their place of work unless there is a true emergency. Let us be careful not to put our leaders’ employment in jeopardy. Members should also be careful not to expect their local leaders to give them the products of those leaders’ occupations. Our leaders are called to give us Church service, not professional services or merchandise inventories.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/bishop-help.p20" pid="kAOgPV6ogkG-Hw45fyVHdQ" hash="kYGQjw">We should remember that our leaders are also husbands and fathers. They are bishops or counselors for a season, but they will never be released from their family responsibilities, which are for eternity. Our leaders need time to perform their family responsibilities also, and our thoughtful consideration will help.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/bishop-help.p21" pid="Fm2t4IF8okeDYFwyGDMivw" hash="8mcWlQ">My heart ached for a young mother who wondered what would necessitate her bishop-husband’s spending six hours counseling a needy member on a Sunday following sacrament meeting. He did not arrive home until 6:00 <small>P.M.</small>, which is bad enough, but this particular Sunday happened to be Christmas Day. I am sure the bishop felt he needed to give the help that was requested, but I also wonder whether a member in distress could not have held some of that need in abeyance long enough for a bishop to enjoy this Christmas afternoon with his family. That is admittedly an extreme example, but the problem is not an exceptional one, as many bishops and their wives would affirm.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/bishop-help.p22" pid="Y41SY55u0ka1BE1XScQq7w" hash="6d9j1w">A more familiar example was mentioned in a ward I recently attended in Salt Lake City. A wife of a member of the bishopric was speaking in sacrament meeting. She thanked the members of the ward for not phoning their home on Monday evening. She said that was the only time in the week when she and her children could plan to have their husband and father all to themselves. That forbearance would be good for all wards and branches.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/bishop-help.p23" pid="9UIq5RVBukCMHJq_Ubsnqg" hash="vnbbxw">Brothers and sisters, the offices of bishop and branch president and counselors are sacred in this Church. The men who hold those offices are respected by the Lord, inspired by His Spirit, and given the powers of discernment necessary to their office. We honor and love them, and we show this by our consideration for them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/bishop-help.p24" pid="xIZuS0MGm0-Of31AlaGbqg" hash="WYh53w">I testify of the Lord Jesus Christ, whose Church this is and whose servants they are. I ask the blessings of the Lord on the members and leaders of this Church, general and local. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

He returned it with a stimulating two-word comment: “Therefore, what?” The talk was incomplete because it omitted a vital element: what a listener should <span class="emphasis">do.</span> I had failed to follow the example of King Benjamin, who concluded an important message by saying, “And now, if you believe all these things see that ye do them” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.10" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 4:10</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/following-the-pioneers.p2" pid="aTzdErgY3kaYnXI7JBHlkw" hash="hOUS-g">For many months we have studied the lives and accomplishments of our pioneers, early and modern. We have thrilled to some modern reenactments, in which many have been blessed to participate. I was humbled to walk in the footsteps and wagon trails of my 31 pioneer ancestors for 13 miles over the Wyoming heights called Rocky Ridge, and for 5 miles on the trail 3 of them later followed down El Cajon Pass to settle what is now San Bernardino, California.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/following-the-pioneers.p3" pid="7hQgRfJ_fke3V3iC18RyGg" hash="TRJPXw">Now after all these studies and activities, it is appropriate to ask ourselves, “Therefore, what?” Are these pioneer celebrations academic, merely increasing our fund of experiences and knowledge? Or will they have a profound impact on how we live our lives?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/following-the-pioneers.p4" pid="BNKjLksjxk2bgB7cWis6HQ" hash="dxPuRg">This question applies to all of us. As President Hinckley reminded us last April, “Whether you are among the posterity of the pioneers or whether you were baptized only yesterday, each is the beneficiary of their great undertaking.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> All of us enjoy the blessings of their efforts, and all of us have the responsibilities which go with that heritage.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/following-the-pioneers.p5" pid="V55lzGpNjkOGA6hO_4B_xg" hash="_4sy_A">It is not enough to study or reenact the accomplishments of our pioneers. We need to identify the great, eternal principles they applied to achieve all they achieved for our benefit and then apply those principles to the challenges of our day. In that way we honor their pioneering efforts, and we also reaffirm our heritage and strengthen its capacity to bless our own posterity and “those millions of our Heavenly Father’s children who have yet to hear and accept the gospel of Jesus Christ.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> We are all pioneers in doing so.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/following-the-pioneers.p6" pid="uncrBCvJn0eItD4guf7suQ" hash="JSmxcQ">Many of our challenges are different from those faced by former pioneers but perhaps just as dangerous and surely as significant to our own salvation and the salvation of those who follow us.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> For example, as for life-threatening obstacles, the wolves that prowled around pioneer settlements were no more dangerous to their children than the drug dealers or pornographers who threaten our children. Similarly, the early pioneers’ physical hunger posed no greater threat to their well-being than the spiritual hunger experienced by many in our day. The children of earlier pioneers were required to do incredibly hard physical work to survive their environment. That was no greater challenge than many of our young people now face from the absence of hard work, which results in spiritually corrosive challenges to discipline, responsibility, and self-worth. Jesus taught: “And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/10.28" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 10:28</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/following-the-pioneers.p7" pid="ouB217EEGky7f4zDSXPsrA" hash="OS3NLw">The foremost quality of our pioneers was <span class="emphasis">faith.</span> With faith in God, they did what every pioneer does—they stepped forward into the unknown: a new religion, a new land, a new way of doing things. With faith in their leaders and in one another, they stood fast against formidable opposition. When their leader said, “This is the right place,” they trusted, and they stayed. When other leaders said, “Do it this way,” they followed in faith.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/following-the-pioneers.p8" pid="7GhOF3k81Ui1Ocdo0F9jkQ" hash="ga5QdA">Two companion qualities evident in the lives of our pioneers, early and modern, are <span class="emphasis">unselfishness</span> and <span class="emphasis">sacrifice.</span> Our Utah pioneers excelled at putting “the general welfare and community goals over individual gain and personal ambition.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> That same quality is evident in the conversion stories of modern pioneers. Upon receiving a testimony of the truth of the restored gospel, they have unhesitatingly sacrificed all that was required to assure that its blessings will be available to their children and to generations unborn. Some have sold all their property to travel to a temple. Some have lost employment. Many have lost friends. Some have even lost parents and extended family, as new converts have been disowned for their faith. This must be the greatest sacrifice of all. Here we recall the Savior’s teaching:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/following-the-pioneers.p9" pid="gyBDmjuaiUulw9HMa4OudQ" hash="xpQDSA">“For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law. …</p>

We should also assure that these same qualities are guiding principles for each of us as we have opportunities to sacrifice for our nations, our families, our quorums, our members, and our Church. This is especially important in societies that have exalted personal interest and individual rights to the point where these values seem to erase the principles of individual responsibility and sacrifice.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/following-the-pioneers.p13" pid="ZUA7eaCo6USqzgsDw-1rrQ" hash="-a5WaQ">Other great qualities in our early pioneers were <span class="emphasis">obedience, unity,</span> and <span class="emphasis">cooperation.</span> We have all thrilled at the example of the Saints who responded to President Brigham Young’s call to rescue the stranded handcart companies, or to pull up roots in settled communities and apply their talents and lives to colonizing new areas.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/following-the-pioneers.p14" pid="-feRIFyvckmpc704wVR_7Q" hash="1nRYEg">Our people have always been characterized by their loyalty and obedience to the direction of their leaders, by their unity, and by their extraordinary capacity to cooperate in a common venture. We see the modern manifestations of these pioneer qualities in the great contributions our brothers and sisters make in a wide variety of private projects and common efforts that require unity and cooperation. Another modern manifestation of Mormon obedience, unity, and cooperation is our unique missionary program, from the preparation and service of young missionaries to the remarkably diverse activities of mature couples throughout the world.</p>

In this and the other examples given, I hope we are not too satisfied with an annual demonstration but will practice these pioneer principles all the days of our lives, as individuals, as families, as Church organizations, and as citizens.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/following-the-pioneers.p16" pid="wvKcrxg2D0ezbZGD92BHUw" hash="tQWXUA">In a day when our prophet has challenged us to reach out to welcome and fellowship new members and to reawaken the faith and fellowship of those who have strayed, we can gain strength from the example of the pioneers. The pioneer legacy is a legacy of <span class="emphasis">inclusion.</span> When the Saints were driven out of Missouri, many were so poor that they lacked teams and wagons to move. Their Church leaders were adamant that none of the poor would be left behind. The response was the same in the exodus from Nauvoo. At a conference of the Church in October 1845, the membership entered into a covenant to take all the Saints with them.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> Thereafter, in the initial epic struggle across Iowa, the companies that arrived first at their stopping place on the Missouri River sent rescue wagons back toward Nauvoo to gather those who had been too poor to leave earlier.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> The revelation that guided their next exodus on the trip west directed each company to “bear an equal proportion … in taking the poor, the widows, the fatherless, and the families of those who have gone into the army” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/136.8" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 136:8</a>). When the wagons and handcarts moved west, their movement was always one of inclusion, and no day’s journey ended until every straggler was accounted for.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/following-the-pioneers.p17" pid="ypyF1F78tUWPWYp8MVwqLg" hash="_h7XKQ">When the Saints settled in the valleys of the mountains, they promptly established a Perpetual Emigrating Fund to assist the poor to move from Winter Quarters, and later from the nations of Europe. At least half of those who journeyed to join the Saints could not have come without the help of leaders and members who were determined to include everyone who desired to gather to Zion. We need that same spirit of inclusion to accomplish our prophet’s clarion call for retention and reactivation.</p>

That word <span class="emphasis">true</span> implies <span class="emphasis">commitment, integrity, endurance,</span> and <span class="emphasis">courage.</span> It reminds us of the Book of Mormon’s description of the 2,000 young warriors:</p>

Do you have the faith and continuing commitment to demonstrate the principles of the gospel in your own lives, consistently? You have served well, but do you, like the pioneers, have the courage and the consistency to be true to the faith and to endure to the end?</p>

As part of their plan, they sought to enlist others in their conspiracy. Among those they invited to a meeting in Nauvoo were two young men still in their teens, Robert Scott and Dennison L. Harris. Dennison’s father, Emer, was the older brother of Martin Harris, one of the Three Witnesses to the Book of Mormon. Being loyal to the Prophet, these young men immediately reported the invitation to Dennison’s father, who advised the Prophet Joseph and sought his advice. Joseph asked Emer Harris to request that the young men attend the meeting, pay strict attention to what was said, make no commitments, and report the entire matter to the Prophet.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/following-the-pioneers.p24" pid="Nbrp3EqSP069TUVDSS_yNw" hash="rW7Caw">As events proceeded, there were three meetings. They began by denouncing Joseph as a fallen prophet, proceeded to considering how Joseph could be overthrown, and concluded with specific planning to kill him. All of this the two young men reported to the Prophet Joseph after each meeting.</p>

He warned them that the conspirators might kill them when they refused the required oath to participate in the murderous scheme. He said he did not think the conspirators would shed their blood because they were so young, but he called upon their loyalty and courage in these words: “Don’t flinch. If you have to die, die like men, you will be martyrs to the cause, and your crowns can be no greater.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> He renewed his original caution that they should not make any promises or enter into any covenants with the conspirators. Then he blessed them and expressed his love for their willingness to risk their lives for him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/following-the-pioneers.p26" pid="Mo98FWu6w0qQpvthhctuPQ" hash="T9NMJA">As Joseph had foreseen, the third and final meeting required all present to unite in a solemn oath to destroy Joseph Smith. When the two boys refused, explaining that Joseph had never harmed them and they were unwilling to participate in his destruction, the leaders declared that since the boys knew the group’s plans, they must agree to join them or they must die on the spot. Knives were drawn.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/following-the-pioneers.p27" pid="kvtBW74n_02AdGvleZ22BA" hash="8LsEBQ">Some protested killing the boys, especially since their parents knew of their presence, so their failure to return would cast suspicion on some of the conspirators. By the barest margin, the cautious course was chosen, and those who opposed killing prevailed. The boys were threatened with certain death if they ever revealed what had transpired in the meetings or who had participated, and they were then allowed to leave unharmed.</p>

They reported everything to him. He thanked and praised them, and then, for their safety, counseled them not to speak of this to anyone for 20 years or more.</p>

These pioneer qualities and the others I have mentioned—integrity, inclusion, cooperation, unity, unselfishness, sacrifice, and obedience—are as vital today as when they guided the actions of our pioneer forebears, early and modern. To honor those pioneers, we must honor and act upon the eternal principles that guided their actions. As President Hinckley reminded us last April, “We honor best those who have gone before when we serve well in the cause of truth.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> That cause of truth is the cause of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, whose servants they were, and whose servants we should strive to be. I testify of this and pray that we, too, may be “true to the faith that our parents have cherished,” in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

We tend to speak of “saved” or “salvation” as a future event rather than something that has already been realized.</p>

This meaning relies on words the Apostle Paul taught the Christians of his day:</p>

We have been converted to the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, we have experienced repentance and baptism, and we are renewing our covenants of baptism by partaking of the sacrament.</p>

In others, salvation must be spoken of as a future event (e.g., <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/5.5" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 5:5</a>) or as conditioned upon a future event (e.g., <a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/13.13" class="scriptureRef">Mark 13:13</a>). But in all of these meanings, or kinds of salvation, salvation is in and through Jesus Christ.</p>

The New Testament frequently refers to the grace of God and to salvation by grace (e.g., <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/1.17" class="scriptureRef">John 1:17</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/15.11" class="scriptureRef">Acts 15:11</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/2.8" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 2:8</a>). But it also has many specific commandments on personal behavior, and many references to the importance of works (e.g., <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.16" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 5:16</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/2.10" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 2:10</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/james/2.14-17" class="scriptureRef">James 2:14–17</a>). In addition, the Savior taught that we must endure to the end in order to be saved (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/10.22" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 10:22</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/13.13" class="scriptureRef">Mark 13:13</a>).</p>

Believers who have had this required rebirth at the hands of those having authority have already been saved from sin <span class="emphasis">conditionally,</span> but they will not be saved <span class="emphasis">finally</span> until they have completed their mortal probation with the required continuing repentance, faithfulness, service, and enduring to the end.</p>

We answer this accusation with the words of two Book of Mormon prophets. Nephi taught, “For we labor diligently … to persuade our children … to believe in Christ, and to be reconciled to God; for we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.23" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 25:23</a>). And what is “all we can do”? It surely includes repentance (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/24.11" class="scriptureRef">Alma 24:11</a>) and baptism, keeping the commandments, and enduring to the end. Moroni pleaded, “Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.32" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 10:32</a>).</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/have-you-been-saved.p14" pid="U8X2dpfQwkKaVdZKUry5ug" hash="Bivg2Q">We are not saved <span class="emphasis">in</span> our sins, as by being unconditionally saved through confessing Christ and then, inevitably, committing sins in our remaining lives (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/11.36-37" class="scriptureRef">Alma 11:36–37</a>). We are saved <span class="emphasis">from</span> our sins (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.10" class="scriptureRef">Hel. 5:10</a>) by a weekly renewal of our repentance and cleansing through the grace of God and His blessed plan of salvation (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.20-22" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 9:20–22</a>).</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/have-you-been-saved.p15" pid="8K4BjUqtNEyH7AyHkyi9Tg" hash="MmiTZw">The question of whether a person has been saved is sometimes phrased in terms of whether that person has been “born again.” Being “born again” is a familiar reference in the Bible and the Book of Mormon. As noted earlier, Jesus taught that except a man was “born again” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/3.3" class="scriptureRef">John 3:3</a>), of water and of the Spirit, he could not enter into the kingdom of God (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/3.5" class="scriptureRef">John 3:5</a>). The Book of Mormon has many teachings about the necessity of being “born again” or “born of God” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/27.25" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 27:25</a>; see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/27.24-26" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 27:24–26</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/36.24,26" class="scriptureRef">Alma 36:24, 26</a>; <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.59" class="scriptureRef">Moses 6:59</a>). As we understand these scriptures, our answer to whether we have been born again is clearly “yes.” We were born again when we entered into a covenant relationship with our Savior by being born of water and of the Spirit and by taking upon us the name of Jesus Christ. We can renew that rebirth each Sabbath when we partake of the sacrament.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/have-you-been-saved.p16" pid="9D6usFqPe0ypX0oKsbcXgA" hash="tX0xfA">Latter-day Saints affirm that those who have been born again in this way are spiritually begotten sons and daughters of Jesus Christ (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.7" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 5:7</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/15.9-13" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 15:9–13</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/27.25" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 27:25</a>). Nevertheless, in order to realize the intended blessings of this born-again status, we must still keep our covenants and endure to the end. In the meantime, through the grace of God, we have been born again as new creatures with new spiritual parentage and the prospects of a glorious inheritance.</p>

The gospel made known to us by the teachings of Jesus Christ has given us this salvation. “I am the light of the world,” Jesus taught; “he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/8.12" class="scriptureRef">John 8:12</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/12.46" class="scriptureRef">John 12:46</a>).</p>

Just as the Resurrection is universal, we affirm that every person who ever lived upon the face of the earth—except for a very few—is assured of salvation in this sense.

This meaning of <span class="emphasis">saved</span> ennobles the whole human race through the grace of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. In this sense of the word, all should answer: “Yes, I have been saved. Glory to God for the gospel and gift and grace of His Son!”</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/have-you-been-saved.p24" pid="GIbbtG1TykuPPPeJ6EK5Ig" hash="all0MA">Finally, in another usage familiar and unique to Latter-day Saints, the words <span class="emphasis">saved</span> and <span class="emphasis">salvation</span> are also used to denote exaltation or eternal life (see <a href="/scriptures/pgp/abr/2.11" class="scriptureRef">Abr. 2:11</a>). This is sometimes referred to as the “fulness of salvation” (Bruce R. McConkie, <span class="emphasis">The Mortal Messiah,</span> 4 vols. [1979–81], 1:242). This salvation requires more than repentance and baptism by appropriate priesthood authority. It also requires the making of sacred covenants, including eternal marriage, in the temples of God, and faithfulness to those covenants by enduring to the end. If we use the word <span class="emphasis">salvation</span> to mean “exaltation,” it is premature for any of us to say that we have been “saved” in mortality. That glorious status can only follow the final judgment of Him who is the Great Judge of the living and the dead.</p>

Some modern prophets have also used “salvation” or “saved” in that same present sense. President Brigham Young declared:</p>

        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/have-you-been-saved.p29" pid="AqA-NDrJ6U2PzgVlRZUVeg" hash="NxHMZA">My most memorable experience with that question occurred some years ago in what we then called the Eastern Bloc. After many years of Communist hostility to religion, these countries were suddenly and miraculously given a measure of religious freedom. When that door opened, many Christian faiths sent missionaries. As part of our preparation to do so, the First Presidency sent members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles to meet with government and church leaders in these countries. Our assignment was to introduce ourselves and to explain what our missionaries would be doing.</p>

Nelson and I called on the leader of the Orthodox Church in one of these countries. Here was a man who had helped keep the light of Christianity burning through the dark decades of Communist repression. I noted in my journal that he was a warm and gracious man who impressed me as a servant of the Lord. I mention this so that you will not think there was any spirit of arrogance or contention in our conversation of nearly an hour. Our visit was pleasant and cordial, filled with the goodwill that should always characterize conversations between men and women who love the Lord and seek to serve Him, each according to his or her own understanding.</p>

He described the various difficulties his church and its work were experiencing as they emerged from that period and sought to regain their former position in the life of the country and the hearts of the people. We introduced ourselves and our fundamental beliefs. We explained that we would soon be sending missionaries into his country and told him how they would perform their labors.</p>

We gave two reasons for this answer—one a matter of principle and the other a matter of practicality. We told him that we preached to believers as well as unbelievers because our message, the restored gospel, makes an important addition to the knowledge, happiness, and peace of all mankind. As a matter of practicality, we preach to believers as well as unbelievers because we cannot tell the difference. I remember asking this distinguished leader, “When you stand before a congregation and look into the faces of the people, can you tell the difference between those who are real believers and those who are not?” He smiled wryly, and I sensed an admission that he had understood the point.</p>

To non-Christians, we witness of Christ and share the truths and ordinances of His restored gospel. To Christians we do the same. Even if a Christian has been “saved” in the familiar single sense discussed earlier, we teach that there remains more to be learned and more to be experienced. As President Hinckley recently said, “[We are] not argumentative. We do not debate. We, in effect, simply say to others, ‘Bring all the good that you have and let us see if we can add to it’” (“The BYU Experience,” BYU devotional address, 4 Nov. 1997).</p>

He did so by laying his hands upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery and speaking these words: “Upon you my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah I confer the Priesthood of Aaron, which holds the keys of the ministering of angels, and of the gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; and this shall never be taken again from the earth, until the sons of Levi do offer again an offering unto the Lord in righteousness” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/13.1" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 13:1</a>).</p>

The meaning is found in the ordinance of baptism and in the sacrament. Baptism is for the remission of sins, and the sacrament is a renewal of the covenants and blessings of baptism. Both should be preceded by repentance. When we keep the covenants made in these ordinances, we are promised that we will always have His Spirit to be with us. The ministering of angels is one of the manifestations of that Spirit.</p>

Baptism is the first of the saving ordinances. When we are baptized, we covenant that we will take upon us the name of Jesus Christ and serve Him and keep His commandments.</p>

He broke bread and blessed it and gave it to His disciples, saying, “Take, eat; this is my body” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/26.26" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 26:26</a>). “This do in remembrance of me” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/22.19" class="scriptureRef">Luke 22:19</a>). He took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them, saying, “This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/26.28" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 26:28</a>).</p>

On that sacred occasion known as the Last Supper, Jesus explained the mission of the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost. The Comforter would testify of Him and reveal other truths. Jesus also explained that He had to leave His disciples in order for the Comforter to come to them. When I depart, He told them, “I will send him unto you” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/16.7" class="scriptureRef">John 16:7</a>). After His Resurrection, He told His Apostles to tarry in Jerusalem until they were given “power from on high” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/24.49" class="scriptureRef">Luke 24:49</a>). That power came when “the promise of the Holy Ghost” was “shed forth” upon the Apostles on the day of Pentecost (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/2.33" class="scriptureRef">Acts 2:33</a>).</p>

The meaning of that promise is evident: “Now, when the multitude had all eaten and drunk, behold, they were filled with the Spirit” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/20.9" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 20:9</a>).</p>

In partaking of the bread, we witness that we are willing to take upon us the name of Jesus Christ and always remember Him and keep His commandments. When we do so, we have the promise that we will always have His Spirit to be with us (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.77" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:77</a>).</p>

The <span class="emphasis">gift</span> of the Holy Ghost was conferred upon us by the authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood after our baptism. But to realize the blessings of that gift, we must keep ourselves free from sin. When we commit sin, we become unclean and the Spirit of the Lord withdraws from us.

Without some provision for further cleansing after our baptism, each of us is lost to things spiritual. We cannot have the companionship of the Holy Ghost, and at the final judgment we would be bound to be “cast off forever” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/10.21" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 10:21</a>). How grateful we are that the Lord has provided a process for each baptized member of His Church to be periodically cleansed from the soil of sin. The sacrament is an essential part of that process.</p>

When we renew our baptismal covenants in this way, the Lord renews the cleansing effect of our baptism. In this way we are made clean and can always have His Spirit to be with us. The importance of this is evident in the Lord’s commandment that we partake of the sacrament each week (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.8-9" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:8–9</a>).</p>

All of these vital steps pertaining to the remission of sins are performed through the saving ordinance of baptism and the renewing ordinance of the sacrament. Both of these ordinances are officiated by holders of the Aaronic Priesthood under the direction of the bishopric, who exercise the keys of the gospel of repentance and of baptism and the remission of sins.</p>

Cannon, <span class="emphasis">Gospel Truth,</span> sel. Jerreld L. Newquist [1987], 54). The scriptures recite numerous instances where an angel appeared personally. Angelic appearances to Zacharias and Mary (see Luke 1) and to King Benjamin and Nephi, the grandson of Helaman (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.2" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 3:2</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/7.17-18" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 7:17–18</a>) are only a few examples. When I was young, I thought such personal appearances were the only meaning of the ministering of angels. As a young holder of the Aaronic Priesthood, I did not think I would see an angel, and I wondered what such appearances had to do with the Aaronic Priesthood.</p>

Angelic messages can be delivered by a voice or merely by thoughts or feelings communicated to the mind.

As explained earlier, through the Aaronic Priesthood ordinances of baptism and the sacrament, we are cleansed of our sins and promised that if we keep our covenants we will always have His Spirit to be with us. I believe that promise not only refers to the Holy Ghost but also to the ministering of angels, for “angels speak by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, they speak the words of Christ” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/32.3" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 32:3</a>). So it is that those who hold the Aaronic Priesthood open the door for all Church members who worthily partake of the sacrament to enjoy the companionship of the Spirit of the Lord and the ministering of angels.</p>

From the scriptures we also know that those who officiate in the priesthood act in behalf of the Lord (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.38" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:38</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/36.2" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 36:2</a>). I will now suggest how teachers and priests and deacons should carry out their sacred responsibilities to act in behalf of the Lord in preparing, administering, and passing the sacrament. I will not suggest detailed rules, since the circumstances in various wards and branches in our worldwide Church are so different that a specific rule that seems required in one setting may be inappropriate in another. Rather, I will suggest a principle based on the doctrines. If all understand this principle and act in harmony with it, there should be little need for rules. If rules or counseling are needed in individual cases, local leaders can provide them, consistent with the doctrines and their related principles.</p>

Teachers’ special assignments in preparing the sacrament are the least visible but should still be done with dignity, quietly and reverently. Teachers should always remember that the emblems they are preparing represent the body and blood of our Lord.</p>

Prayers that are rattled off swiftly or mumbled inaudibly will not do. All present should be helped to understand an ordinance and covenants so important that the Lord prescribed the exact words to be uttered. All should be helped to focus on those sacred words as they renew their covenants by partaking.</p>

As a 16-year-old priest, I was just beginning a part-time job as a radio announcer at a local station. After I offered a prayer at the sacrament table in our ward, a girl who was present told me I sounded like I was reading a commercial. Can you imagine the shame I felt? After 50 years that rebuke still stings. Brethren, remember the significance of those sacred prayers. You are praying as a servant of the Lord in behalf of the entire congregation. Speak to be heard and understood, and say it like you mean it.</p>

If someone officiating in this sacred ordinance is unworthy to participate, and this is known to anyone present, their participation is a serious distraction to that person. Young men, if any of you is unworthy, talk to your bishop without delay. Obtain his direction on what you should do to qualify yourself to participate in your priesthood duties worthily and appropriately.</p>

With the single exception of those priests occupied breaking the bread, all who hold the Aaronic Priesthood should join in singing the sacrament hymn by which we worship and prepare to partake. No one needs that spiritual preparation more than the priesthood holders who will officiate in it. My young brethren, it is important that you sing the sacrament hymn. Please do so.</p>

Their written “Testimony of Three Witnesses” has been included in all of the almost 100 million copies of the Book of Mormon the Church has published since 1830. These witnesses solemnly testify that they “have seen the plates which contain this record” and “the engravings which are upon the plates.” They witness that these writings “have been translated by the gift and power of God, for his voice hath declared it unto us.” They testify, “We declare with words of soberness, that an angel of God came down from heaven, and he brought and laid before our eyes, that we beheld and saw the plates, and the engravings thereon; and we know that it is by the grace of God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, that we beheld and bear record that these things are true.”</p>

The solemn written testimony of three witnesses to what they saw and heard—two of them simultaneously and the third almost immediately thereafter—is entitled to great weight. Indeed, we know that upon the testimony of <span class="emphasis">one</span> witness great miracles have been claimed and accepted by many religious people, and in the secular world the testimony of one witness has been deemed sufficient for weighty penalties and judgments.</p>

Each of the three had ample reason and opportunity to renounce his testimony if it had been false, or to equivocate on details if any had been inaccurate. As is well known, because of disagreements or jealousies involving other leaders of the Church, each one of these three witnesses was excommunicated from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints by about eight years after the publication of their testimony. All three went their separate ways, with no common interest to support a collusive effort. Yet to the end of their lives—periods ranging from 12 to 50 years after their excommunications—not one of these witnesses deviated from his published testimony or said anything that cast any shadow on its truthfulness.</p>

Reject it one may, but how does one explain three men of good character uniting and persisting in this published testimony to the end of their lives in the face of great ridicule and other personal disadvantage? Like the Book of Mormon itself, there is no better explanation than is given in the testimony itself, the solemn statement of good and honest men who told what they saw.</p>

He was a prosperous and respected citizen of Palmyra, New York. He owned a farm of over 240 acres, large for the time and place. He was an honored veteran of two battles in the War of 1812. His fellow citizens entrusted him with many elective offices and responsibilities in the community. He was universally respected for his industry and integrity. Assessments by contemporaries described him as “an industrious, hard-working farmer, shrewd in his business calculations, frugal in his habits,” and “strictly upright in his business dealings” (quoted in Richard Lloyd Anderson, <span class="emphasis">Investigating the Book of Mormon Witnesses</span> [1981], 96–97, 98).</p>

There, in April 1828, Joseph Smith began his first persistent translation of the Book of Mormon. He dictated, and Martin Harris wrote until there were 116 pages of manuscript.</p>

For this the Lord rebuked Martin and Joseph. Joseph had his gift of translation suspended for a season, and Martin was rebuked as “a wicked man” who had “set at naught the counsels of God, and … broken the most sacred promises which were made before God” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/3.12-13" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 3:12–13</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/10.title" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 10</a>). Fortunately, both Joseph and Martin were later forgiven by the Lord, and the work of translation resumed with other scribes. We obviously honor Joseph for his magnificent ministry, but Martin’s subsequent faithfulness continues under a shadow from which this important man should be rescued.</p>

In August 1829 he mortgaged his home and farm to Egbert B. Grandin to secure payment on the printer’s contract. Seven months later, the 5,000 copies of the first printing of the Book of Mormon were completed. Later, when the mortgage note fell due, the home and a portion of the farm were sold for $3,000.

A year later he was called to journey to Missouri with Joseph Smith, Sidney Rigdon, and Edward Partridge (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/52.24" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 52:24</a>). In Missouri that year—1831—he was commanded to “be an example unto the church, in laying his moneys before the bishop of the church” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.35" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 58:35</a>), thus becoming the first man the Lord called by name to consecrate his property in Zion. Two months later he was named with Joseph Smith, Oliver Cowdery, Sidney Rigdon, and others to be “stewards over the revelations and commandments” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/70.3" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 70:3</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/70.1" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 70:1</a>), a direction to publish and circulate what later became the Doctrine and Covenants.</p>

Emer spent a year preaching the gospel near his former home in northeastern Pennsylvania. During most of this time Emer’s companion was his brother Martin, whose zeal in preaching even caused him to be jailed for a few days. The Harris brothers baptized about 100 persons. Among those baptized was a family named Oaks, which included my great-great-grandfather. Thus, my middle name and my last name come from the grandfathers who met in that missionary encounter in Susquehanna County in 1832–33.</p>

Less than three months later, he left Kirtland with the men of Zion’s Camp, marching 900 miles to Missouri to relieve the oppressed Saints there.</p>

The Three Witnesses, including Martin Harris, were appointed to “search out the Twelve” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/18.37" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 18:37</a>), to select them and, under authority granted by the Prophet and his counselors, to ordain them [these ordinations were then confirmed under the hands of the First Presidency] (see B.

During 1837 there were intense financial and spiritual conflicts in Kirtland, Ohio. Martin Harris later said that he “lost confidence in Joseph Smith” and “his mind became darkened” (quoted in Anderson, <span class="emphasis">Investigating the Book of Mormon Witnesses,</span> 110). He was released from the high council in September 1837 and three months later was excommunicated.</p>

Within a year thereafter, Martin and his family located in Kirtland, and Martin married Caroline Young, a niece of Brigham Young.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/the-witness-martin-harris.p28" pid="6VkSxYliikaREDkrq6tcMw" hash="9ef3mA">When most of the Saints moved on—to Missouri, to Nauvoo, and to the West—Martin Harris remained in Kirtland. There he was rebaptized by a visiting missionary in 1842. In 1856 Caroline and their four children took the long journey to Utah, but Martin, then 73 years of age, remained on his property in Kirtland. In 1860 he told a census taker that he was a “Mormon preacher,” evidence of his continuing loyalty to the restored gospel. Later he would tell a visitor, “I never did leave the Church; the Church left me” (quoted in William H. Homer Jr., “‘Publish It Upon the Mountains’: The Story of Martin Harris,” <span class="emphasis">Improvement Era,</span> July 1955, 505), meaning of course that Brigham Young led the Church west and the aging Martin remained in Kirtland.</p>

A Utah interviewer of the 87-year-old man described him as “remarkably vigorous for one of his years, … his memory being very good” (<span class="emphasis">Deseret News,</span> 31 Aug. 1870). He was rebaptized, a common practice at that time, and spoke twice to audiences in this Tabernacle. We have no official report of what he said, but we can be sure of his central message since over 35 persons left similar personal accounts of what he told them during this period. One reported Martin saying, “It is not a mere belief, but is a matter of knowledge. I saw the plates and the inscriptions thereon. I saw the angel, and he showed them unto me” (quoted in Anderson, <span class="emphasis">Investigating the Book of Mormon Witnesses,</span> 116).</p>

At the heart of this college teacher’s powerful impact on his student was the student’s conviction that this teacher really cared for him and wanted him to learn and do what would help him find happiness. The author concluded his tribute with this question: “Have you ever really had a teacher? One who saw you as a raw but precious thing, a jewel that, with wisdom, could be polished to a proud shine? If you are lucky enough to find your way to such teachers, you will always find your way back.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

In the Lord’s great plan of salvation there are no more important teachers than parents, who teach their children constantly by example and by precept. Each of us teaches those around us by example. Even children teach one another. Every missionary is a teacher. And every leader is a teacher.

The Twelve, assisted by the Seventy, accepted that challenge.

When we are called to teach, we should accept our calling and teach because of our love for God the Eternal Father and His Son, Jesus Christ. In addition, a gospel teacher should always teach with love for the students. We are taught that we should pray “with all the energy of heart, … [to] be filled with this love” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.48" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 7:48</a>). Love of God and love of His children is the highest reason for service. Those who teach out of love will be magnified as instruments in the hands of Him whom they serve.</p>

          <span class="emphasis">Second,</span> a gospel teacher, like the Master we serve, will concentrate entirely on those being taught. His or her total concentration will be on the needs of the sheep—the good of the students. A gospel teacher does not focus on himself or herself. One who understands that principle will not look upon his or her calling as “giving or presenting a lesson,” because that definition views teaching from the standpoint of the teacher, not the student.</p>

This means that a gospel teacher must never indulge in priestcrafts, which are “that men preach and set themselves up for a light unto the world, that they may get gain and praise of the world” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.29" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 26:29</a>). A gospel teacher does not preach “to become popular” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/1.3" class="scriptureRef">Alma 1:3</a>) or “for the sake of riches and honor” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/1.16" class="scriptureRef">Alma 1:16</a>). He or she follows the marvelous Book of Mormon example in which “the preacher was no better than the hearer, neither was the teacher any better than the learner” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/1.26" class="scriptureRef">Alma 1:26</a>). Both will always look to the Master.</p>

That is not acceptable. A gospel teacher is not called to choose the subject of the lesson but to teach and discuss what has been specified. Gospel teachers should also be scrupulous to avoid hobby topics, personal speculations, and controversial subjects. The Lord’s revelations and the directions of His servants are clear on this point.

Relying on clear scriptural teachings, Latter-day Saints join in affirming that Christ has “broken the bands of death” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/16.7" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 16:7</a>) and that “death is swallowed up in victory” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15.54" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 15:54</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/morm/7.5" class="scriptureRef">Morm. 7:5</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/15.8" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 15:8</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/16.7-8" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 16:7–8</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/22.14" class="scriptureRef">Alma 22:14</a>).

The prophet Amulek taught, “That same spirit which doth possess your bodies at the time that ye go out of this life, that same spirit will have power to possess your body in that eternal world” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.34" class="scriptureRef">Alma 34:34</a>). As a result, when persons leave this life and go on to the next, “they who are righteous shall be righteous still” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.16" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 9:16</a>), and “whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life … will rise with us in the resurrection” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.18" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 130:18</a>).</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/resurrection.p32" pid="GropiSlpc0mzezjXiuHoHg" hash="FpGgng">The principle of restoration also means that persons who are not righteous in mortal life will not rise up righteous in the resurrection (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.16" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 9:16</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15.35-44" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 15:35–44</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.27-32" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:27–32</a>). Moreover, unless our mortal sins have been cleansed and blotted out by repentance and forgiveness (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.21" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:21</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.45-46" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 9:45–46</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.42" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 58:42</a>), we will be resurrected with a “bright recollection” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/11.43" class="scriptureRef">Alma 11:43</a>) and a “perfect knowledge of all of our guilt, and our uncleanness” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.14" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 9:14</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.18" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:18</a>). The seriousness of that reality is emphasized by the many scriptures suggesting that the resurrection is followed immediately by the Final Judgment (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.15,22" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 9:15, 22</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/26.25" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 26:25</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/11.43-44" class="scriptureRef">Alma 11:43–44</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/42.23" class="scriptureRef">Alma 42:23</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/morm/7.6" class="scriptureRef">Morm. 7:6</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/morm/9.13-14" class="scriptureRef">Morm. 9:13–14</a>). Truly, “this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.32" class="scriptureRef">Alma 34:32</a>).</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/resurrection.p33" pid="9x7gshitdkuLWmvTFUzNYQ" hash="NFfRjg">The assurance that the resurrection will include an opportunity to be with our family members—husband, wife, parents, brothers and sisters, children, and grandchildren—is a powerful encouragement for us to fulfill our family responsibilities in mortality. It helps us live together in love in this life in anticipation of joyful reunions and associations in the next.</p>

Thus, the people of Ammon in the Book of Mormon “never did look upon death with any degree of terror, for their hope and views of Christ and the resurrection; therefore, death was swallowed up to them by the victory of Christ over it” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/27.28" class="scriptureRef">Alma 27:28</a>).</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/resurrection.p35" pid="6BaT_cfkaku6JEngyLANsw" hash="LWIvgg">The assurance of immortality also helps us bear the mortal separations involved in the death of our loved ones. Every one of us has wept at a death, grieved through a funeral, or stood in pain at a graveside. I am surely one who has. We should all praise God for the assured resurrection that makes our mortal separations temporary and gives us the hope and strength to carry on.</p>

Our temples are living, working testimonies to our faith in the reality of the resurrection. They provide the sacred settings where living proxies can perform all of the necessary ordinances of mortal life in behalf of those who live in the world of the spirits. None of this would be meaningful if we did not have the assurance of universal immortality and the opportunity for eternal life because of the Resurrection of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.</p>

This process requires far more than acquiring knowledge. It is not even enough for us to be <span class="emphasis">convinced</span> of the gospel; we must act and think so that we are <span class="emphasis">converted</span> by it. In contrast to the institutions of the world, which teach us to <span class="emphasis">know</span> something, the gospel of Jesus Christ challenges us to <span class="emphasis">become</span> something.</p>

Moroni declares, “He that <span class="emphasis">is</span> filthy shall be filthy still; and he that <span class="emphasis">is </span>righteous shall be righteous still” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/morm/9.14" class="scriptureRef">Morm. 9:14</a>; emphasis added; see also <a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/22.11-12" class="scriptureRef">Rev. 22:11–12</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.16" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 9:16</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.35" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:35</a>). The same would be true of “selfish” or “disobedient” or any other personal attribute inconsistent with the requirements of God. Referring to the “state” of the wicked in the Final Judgment, Alma explains that if we are condemned by our words, our works, and our thoughts, “we shall not be found spotless; … and in this awful state we shall not dare to look up to our God” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/12.14" class="scriptureRef">Alma 12:14</a>).</p>

The commandments, ordinances, and covenants of the gospel are not a list of deposits required to be made in some heavenly account.

The conversion we must achieve requires us to be a good husband and father or a good wife and mother. Being a successful Church leader is not enough. Exaltation is an eternal family experience, and it is our mortal family experiences that are best suited to prepare us for it.</p>

Some are submerged in service to a disadvantaged family member. Others suffer the death of a loved one or the loss or postponement of a righteous goal like marriage or childbearing. Still others struggle with personal impairments or with feelings of rejection, inadequacy, or depression. Through the justice and mercy of a loving Father in Heaven, the refinement and sanctification possible through such experiences can help us achieve what God desires us to become.</p>

This is achieved not just by doing what is right, but by doing it for the right reason—for the pure love of Christ. The Apostle Paul illustrated this in his famous teaching about the importance of charity (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13.title" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 13</a>). The reason charity never fails and the reason charity is greater than even the most significant acts of goodness he cited is that charity, “the pure love of Christ” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.47" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 7:47</a>), is not an <span class="emphasis">act</span> but a <span class="emphasis">condition</span> or state of being. Charity is attained through a succession of acts that result in a conversion. Charity is something one becomes. Thus, as Moroni declared, “except men shall <span class="emphasis">have</span> charity they cannot inherit” the place prepared for them in the mansions of the Father (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.34" class="scriptureRef">Ether 12:34</a>; emphasis added).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/the-challenge-to-become.p27" pid="H-H4zWH5JEa6SppxqELTuA" hash="3c0rEQ">All of this helps us understand an important meaning of the parable of the laborers in the vineyard, which the Savior gave to explain what the kingdom of heaven is like. As you remember, the owner of the vineyard hired laborers at different times of the day. Some he sent into the vineyard early in the morning, others about the third hour, and others in the sixth and ninth hours. Finally, in the eleventh hour he sent others into the vineyard, promising that he would also pay them “whatsoever is right” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/20.7" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 20:7</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/the-challenge-to-become.p28" pid="Ni1QvHnkI02MMkvc4KqhAQ" hash="qEWvmg">At the end of the day the owner of the vineyard gave the same wage to every worker, even to those who had come in the eleventh hour. When those who had worked the entire day saw this, “they murmured against the goodman of the house” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/20.11" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 20:11</a>). The owner did not yield but merely pointed out that he had done no one any wrong, since he had paid each man the agreed amount.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/the-challenge-to-become.p29" pid="zit8s0t1ZUKweWNjxJTkLg" hash="f9mUpg">Like other parables, this one can teach several different and valuable principles. For present purposes its lesson is that the Master’s reward in the Final Judgment will not be based on how long we have labored in the vineyard. We do not obtain our heavenly reward by punching a time clock. What is essential is that our labors in the workplace of the Lord have caused us to <span class="emphasis">become</span> something. For some of us, this requires a longer time than for others. What is important in the end is what we have become by our labors. Many who come in the eleventh hour have been refined and prepared by the Lord in ways other than formal employment in the vineyard. These workers are like the prepared dry mix to which it is only necessary to “add water”—the perfecting ordinance of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost. With that addition—even in the eleventh hour—these workers are in the same state of development and qualified to receive the same reward as those who have labored long in the vineyard.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/the-challenge-to-become.p30" pid="ChhJeKk-3E-pj7qnABB09w" hash="YB5V_g">This parable teaches us that we should never give up hope and loving associations with family members and friends whose fine qualities (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.5-14" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 7:5–14</a>) evidence their progress toward what a loving Father would have them become. Similarly, the power of the Atonement and the principle of repentance show that we should never give up on loved ones who now seem to be making many wrong choices.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/the-challenge-to-become.p31" pid="BzbUIgLPI0Sbp5uN2Q4Sqg" hash="toEYOg">Instead of being judgmental about others, we should be concerned about ourselves. We must not give up hope. We must not stop striving. We are children of God, and it is possible for us to become what our Heavenly Father would have us become.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/the-challenge-to-become.p33" pid="OFrneIVbn0qi_0O9hzHFPg" hash="cSDi8A">After King Benjamin’s great sermon, many of his hearers cried out that the Spirit of the Lord “has wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.2" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 5:2</a>). If we are losing our desire to do evil, we are progressing toward our heavenly goal.</p>

I understand this to mean that persons who are proceeding toward the needed conversion are beginning to see things as our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, see them. They are hearing His voice instead of the voice of the world, and they are doing things in His way instead of by the ways of the world.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/focus-and-priorities.p2" pid="-ICnsSYprUKc_lYIMqLgLw" hash="nKoozg">We are accountable and will be judged for how we use what we have received. This eternal principle applies to all we have been given. In the parable of the talents (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/25.14-30" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 25:14–30</a>), the Savior taught this principle with reference to the use of property. The principle of accountability also applies to the spiritual resources conferred in the teachings we have been given and to the precious hours and days allotted to each of us during our time in mortality.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/focus-and-priorities.p3" pid="VL9j3zg6sUmbQBP55QRDrw" hash="Mqy9pQ">I wish to examine how this principle of accountability applies to our use of the enlarged time and information we have been given in our day.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/focus-and-priorities.p4" pid="Kfw26sQvDUijPi4d5gHvig" hash="ggWguQ">Because of increased life expectancies and modern timesaving devices, most of us have far more discretionary time than our predecessors. We are accountable for how we use that time. “Thou shalt not idle away thy time” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/60.13" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 60:13</a>), and “Cease to be idle” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.124" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:124</a>), the Lord commanded the early missionaries and members. “Time flies on wings of lightning,” we sing in a popular hymn; “we cannot call it back. It comes, then passes forward along its onward track. And if we are not mindful, the chance will fade away, for life is quick in passing. ’Tis as a single day” (“Improve the Shining Moments,” <span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> no. 226).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/focus-and-priorities.p5" pid="edILFgp8n0etuYBV7ACqDw" hash="7pu6Jw">The significance of our increased discretionary time has been magnified many times by modern data-retrieval technology. For good or for evil, devices like the Internet and the compact disc have put at our fingertips an incredible inventory of information, insights, and images. Along with fast food, we have fast communications and fast facts. The effect of these resources on some of us seems to fulfill the prophet Daniel’s prophecy that in the last days “knowledge shall be increased” and “many shall run to and fro” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/dan/12.4" class="scriptureRef">Dan. 12:4</a>).</p>

They obtained a truck and drove it to a farmer’s field, where they purchased a truckload of melons for a dollar a melon. They drove the loaded truck to their shed by the road, where they sold their melons for a dollar a melon. They drove back to the farmer’s field and bought another truckload of melons for a dollar a melon. Transporting them to the roadside, they again sold them for a dollar a melon. As they drove back toward the farmer’s field to get another load, one partner said to the other, “We’re not making much money on this business, are we?” “No, we’re not,” his partner replied. “Do you think we need a bigger truck?”</p>

Some choose to spend countless hours in unfocused surfing the Internet, watching trivial television, or scanning other avalanches of information. But to what purpose? Those who engage in such activities are like the two partners in my story, hurrying to and fro, hauling more and more but failing to grasp the essential truth that we cannot make a profit from our efforts until we understand the true value of what is already within our grasp.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/focus-and-priorities.p11" pid="gqbtRv4PqUC9CZ3nhFkmUQ" hash="wTRC7Q">A poet described this delusion as an “endless cycle” that brings “knowledge of words, and ignorance of the Word,” in which “wisdom” is “lost in knowledge” and “knowledge” is “lost in information” (T.

Yet which of us would think ourselves a thousand times more educated or more serviceable to our fellowmen than they? The sublime quality of what these two men gave to us—including the Declaration of Independence and the Gettysburg Address—was not attributable to their great resources of information, for their libraries were comparatively small by our standards. Theirs was the wise and inspired use of a limited amount of information.</p>

(Today such a library would include millions of additional pages available by electronic data retrieval.) When I began to prepare an assigned paper, I spent many days searching in hundreds of books for the needed material. I soon learned the obvious truth (already familiar to experienced researchers) that I could never complete my assigned task within the available time unless I focused my research in the beginning and stopped that research soon enough to have time to analyze my findings and compose my conclusions.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/focus-and-priorities.p15" pid="yi8EERfFRkSZqxEgQaM5TQ" hash="Yyi4_Q">Faced with an excess of information in the marvelous resources we have been given, we must begin with focus or we are likely to become like those in the well-known prophecy about people in the last days—“ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-tim/3.7" class="scriptureRef">2 Tim. 3:7</a>). We also need quiet time and prayerful pondering as we seek to develop information into knowledge and mature knowledge into wisdom.</p>

The abundant information and images accessible on the Internet call for sharp focus and control to avoid accessing the pornography that is an increasing scourge in our society. As the <span class="emphasis">Deseret News</span> noted in a recent editorial, “Images that used to be hidden in out-of-the-way store counters now are as close as a mouse click” (“Staying ahead of Pornography,” 21–22 Feb. 2001, A12). The Internet has made pornography accessible almost without effort and often without leaving the privacy of one’s home or room. The Internet has also facilitated the predatory activities of adults who use its anonymity and accessibility to stalk children for evil purposes. Parents and youth, beware!</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/focus-and-priorities.p17" pid="pqjWeKPBPESiMVI3ZtUiNA" hash="lE6rCg">There are many gospel implications of this easily accessible flood of information. For example, our Church Web site now provides access to all of the general conference addresses and other contents of Church magazines for the past 30 years. Teachers can download bales of information on any subject. When highly focused, a handout can enrich. But a bale of handouts can detract from our attempt to teach gospel principles with clarity and testimony. Stacks of supplementary material can impoverish rather than enrich, because they can blur students’ focus on the assigned principles and draw them away from prayerfully seeking to apply those principles in their own lives.</p>

That is focus. Nephi also said that as he taught from the scriptures, “I did liken all scriptures unto us, that it might be for our profit and learning” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/19.23" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 19:23</a>).

Or compare the value to each of us of some other facts or advice from the distant past with what our stake president said at our last stake conference or what our bishop counseled us last Sunday.</p>

The work of God is to bring to pass the eternal life of His children (see <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:39</a>), and all that this entails in the birth, nurturing, teaching, and sealing of our Heavenly Father’s children. Everything else is lower in priority. Think about that reality as we consider some teachings and some examples on priorities. As someone has said, if we do not choose the kingdom of God first, it will make little difference in the long run what we have chosen instead of it.</p>

That knowledge is obtained from the explicit and symbolic teachings of the endowment, and from the whisperings of the Spirit that come as we are desirous to seek and receptive to hear the revelation available to us in that sacred place.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/focus-and-priorities.p26" pid="DCnyzUxAV0i-zXkULcukDA" hash="_GVNlQ">As regards property, Jesus taught that “a man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/12.15" class="scriptureRef">Luke 12:15</a>). Consequently, we should not lay up for ourselves “treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/6.19" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 6:19</a>). In other words, the treasures of our hearts—our priorities—should not be what the scriptures call “riches [and] the vain things of this world” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/39.14" class="scriptureRef">Alma 39:14</a>). The “vain things of [the] world” include every combination of that worldly quartet of property, pride, prominence, and power. As to all of these, the scriptures remind us that “you cannot carry them with you” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/39.14" class="scriptureRef">Alma 39:14</a>). We should be seeking the kind of treasures the scriptures promise the faithful: “great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/89.19" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 89:19</a>).</p>

Among the most visible such examples are the men and women who set aside their worldly pursuits and even say good-bye to their families to serve missions for the Lord. Tens of thousands of these are young missionaries. In addition, I pay particular tribute to those who serve missions in their mature years, some as mission leaders and some as what we call couple missionaries. Their remarkable service evidences their priorities, and their impressive example is a guide to their families and to all who know them.</p>

For example, how do family members spend their free time together? Time together is necessary but not sufficient. Priorities should govern us in the precious time we give to our family relationships.

In all such choices we need to have inspired priorities and apply them in ways that will bring eternal blessings to us and to our family members.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/focus-and-priorities.p32" pid="iq8_0QiOkky6UbhDo0Z3QA" hash="YuyQ0w">Then, after we have done all that we can, we should remember the wise counsel and comforting assurance of King Benjamin, who taught, “And see that all these things are done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.27" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 4:27</a>).</p>

Second, we seek to understand our relationship to our family members and to secure those relationships by the ordinances of the temple and by keeping the covenants we make in that holy place. These relationships, secured in the way I have explained, provide eternal blessings available in no other way. No combination of science, success, property, pride, prominence, or power can provide these eternal blessings!</p>

In a worldwide satellite address to missionaries and local leaders, he asked for “an infusion of enthusiasm” for missionary work “at every level in the Church” (“Find the Lambs, Feed the Sheep,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 1999, 107). Though missionaries must continue their best efforts to find persons to teach, he declared that the “better way … is through the members of the Church” (105). He asked each of us to give our very best efforts to assisting missionaries in finding persons to teach. He also asked that each stake president and each bishop “accept full responsibility and accountability for the finding and friendshipping of investigators” within their units (107). President Hinckley also invoked the blessings of the Lord upon each of us “in meeting the tremendous challenge that is ours” (104).</p>

        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/sharing-the-gospel.p12" pid="TQZlASHiPEmTQwUvLrRiIg" hash="Q17BMg">First, we must have a firm testimony of the truth and importance of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. This includes the supreme value of God’s plan for His children, the essential position of the Atonement of Jesus Christ in it, and the role of The Church of Jesus Christ in carrying out that plan in mortality.</p>

In modern revelation we are told that “love, with an eye single to the glory of God, qualify [us] for the work” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/4.5" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 4:5</a>). The early Apostles of this dispensation were told that their love should “abound unto all men” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/112.11" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 112:11</a>).</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/sharing-the-gospel.p14" pid="BVHSKDlSuUu6blJdMSqhrw" hash="ZVaYzw">From our testimony of the truth and importance of the restored gospel, we understand the value of what we have been given. From our love of God and our fellowmen, we acquire our desire to share that great gift with everyone. The intensity of our desire to share the gospel is a great indicator of the extent of our personal conversion.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/sharing-the-gospel.p15" pid="UziCru1bcUaYIMfpWT2Qvw" hash="flIKZA">The Book of Mormon contains some marvelous examples of the effect of testimony and love. When the sons of Mosiah, who had been “the very vilest of sinners,” acquired their testimony, “they were desirous that salvation should be declared to every creature, for they could not bear that any human soul should perish” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/28.3-4" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 28:3–4</a>). In a later account, their associate, Alma, cried, “O that I were an angel, … that I might go forth and speak with the trump of God, with a voice to shake the earth” and declare “the plan of redemption” to every soul, “that there might not be more sorrow upon all the face of the earth” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/29.1-2" class="scriptureRef">Alma 29:1–2</a>).</p>

The word <span class="emphasis">sharing</span> affirms that we have something extraordinarily valuable and desire to give it to others for their benefit and blessing.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/sharing-the-gospel.p17" pid="rWwDN_kcvUiVH0iXPDPw3w" hash="bJwjwQ">The most effective missionaries, member and full-time, always act out of love. I learned this lesson as a young man. I was assigned to visit a less-active member, a successful professional many years older than I. Looking back on my actions, I realize that I had very little loving concern for the man I visited. I acted out of duty, with a desire to report 100 percent on my home teaching. One evening, close to the end of a month, I phoned to ask if my companion and I could come right over and visit him. His chastening reply taught me an unforgettable lesson.</p>

I’ve already dressed for bed. I am reading, and I am just not willing to be interrupted so that you can report 100 percent on your home teaching this month.” That reply still stings me because I knew he had sensed my selfish motivation.</p>

The prophet Mormon’s writings about “the pure love of Christ” teach us to “pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.47-48" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 7:47–48</a>).</p>

Just as our desires must be pure and rooted in testimony and love, our actions must be directed by the Lord. It is His work, not ours, and it must be done in His way and on His timing, not ours. Otherwise, our efforts may be fated to frustration and failure.</p>

To be effective, our efforts with them must be directed by the Lord so that we act in the way and at the time when they will be most receptive. We must pray for the Lord’s help and directions so we can be instruments in His hands for one who is now ready—one He would have us help today. Then, we must be alert to hear and heed the promptings of His Spirit in how we proceed.</p>

We know from countless personal testimonies that in His own way and His own time the Lord is preparing persons to accept His gospel. Such persons are searching, and when we are seeking to identify them the Lord will answer their prayers through answering ours. He will prompt and guide those who desire and who sincerely seek guidance in how, where, when, and with whom to share His gospel. In this way, God grants unto us according to our desires (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/29.4" class="scriptureRef">Alma 29:4</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6.8" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 6:8</a>).</p>

When we are standing as “witnesses of God at all times and in all things” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.9" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 18:9</a>), the Lord will open ways for us to find and have appropriate communications with those who are seeking. This will come when we seek direction and when we act out of a sincere and Christlike love for others.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/sharing-the-gospel.p25" pid="ynwe4eM_SkOS3QomS5SkIA" hash="uBUDEA">The Lord loves all of His children.

How do we proceed? We begin by beginning. We should not wait for a further invitation from heaven. Revelation comes most often when we are on the move.</p>

When He was asked, “Who is my neighbour?” the Savior told of a Samaritan who recognized a neighbor on the road to Jericho (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/10.25-37" class="scriptureRef">Luke 10:25–37</a>). Thus, our neighbors also include those we encounter in our daily travels.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/sharing-the-gospel.p28" pid="qTTiHUADpECB12148IHFsw" hash="4AMa3A">We should pray, as Alma of old, for the Lord to give us “power and wisdom that we may bring” our associates to the Lord (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/31.35" class="scriptureRef">Alma 31:35</a>). We also pray for the welfare of their souls (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/6.6" class="scriptureRef">Alma 6:6</a>).</p>

The warning against those who use Church position to gratify their pride or vain ambition (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.37" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:37</a>) surely applies to our efforts to share the gospel.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/sharing-the-gospel.p30" pid="Hs3sKTWAkUKJ0qPRot9rbQ" hash="ZJzCeg">The need to act out of love also warns us against manipulation, real or perceived. People who do not share our belief can be repelled when they hear us refer to something as a “missionary tool.” A “tool” is something used to manipulate an inanimate object. If we talk about something as a “missionary tool,” we can convey the impression that we want to manipulate someone. That impression is entirely contrary to the unselfish, sharing spirit of our missionary service.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/sharing-the-gospel.p31" pid="PDWcifcrykW6am4wm3-OhQ" hash="ejdy9w">In his great message President Hinckley declares that “opportunities for sharing the gospel are everywhere” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 1999, 106). He mentions many things we can do. We should live so that what he called “the tremendous power of the example of a member of the Church” (104) will influence those around us. “The most effective tract we will carry,” he said, “will be the goodness of our own lives and example” (107). We must be sincerely friendly to all.</p>

We can offer our homes “to carry on this missionary service” (105). The missionaries “may appropriately ask the members for referrals” (107), and when they do, we should respond.</p>

We can invite friends to Church meetings or Church-related activities.

These cards are an ideal way to invite people to investigate the additional truths we have to share. In a nonintrusive way, they offer something precious, but the gift depends upon the choice and initiative of the potential recipient. In our experience, a significant fraction of those who telephone for the offered gift choose to have it delivered by those who can tell them more.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/sharing-the-gospel.p36" pid="IrqrLwZB-06FKBfebCPolA" hash="DM_8dA">The Church has just announced another way to share the gospel, worldwide, on the Internet. In its potential, this new initiative is as exciting as the publishing of written tracts in the 19th century and our use of radio, television, and film in the 20th. The Church has activated a new Internet site to which we may refer persons interested in obtaining information about the Church and its doctrine and how they can find a place to worship with us. Its address is <a href="http://www.mormon.org">www.mormon.org</a>. For missionaries, the value and use of this new resource will emerge with experience. For members of the Church, it will help us answer the questions of friends directly or by referring them to the site. It will also allow us to send our friends electronic greeting cards that include gospel messages and invitations.</p>

They may attend sporadically, but they are not yet enjoying the full blessings of Church participation and service. Others may attend regularly, but refrain from commitments and from seeking the personal spiritual rebirth that comes from yielding our hearts to God. Both kinds are missing some unique blessings in this life. And both are in jeopardy of missing the most glorious blessings in the life to come.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/the-gospel-in-our-lives.p3" pid="ltkEAx5zrka2ecPscBVeCg" hash="lhrqZA">Paul taught that the Lord gave prophets and apostles for “the perfecting of the saints, … the work of the ministry, … [and] the edifying of the body of Christ” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/4.12" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 4:12</a>). Persons who are not fully participating in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and also seeking a personal spiritual conversion are missing out on experiences that are essential under the divinely established great plan of happiness. The teachings and the work of the Church are essential to bring to pass the eternal life of man (see <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:39</a>).</p>

I pray especially that some who are not yet enjoying the blessings of full Church participation and commitment will seek and obtain that witness and act upon it.</p>

Considering all the Savior has done for us, I replied it should be easy to offer something in service to Him and our fellowmen. My questioner considered that idea for a moment and then voiced this astonishing reply: “What’s He done for me?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/the-gospel-in-our-lives.p6" pid="_5oShd6e6Emxg2r_zb_gyQ" hash="Qabp1w">This astonishing answer moved me to ponder what people expect to receive from Jesus Christ, from His gospel, and from participating in His Church. I thought of some others who said they stopped going to Church because the Church was “not meeting their needs.” Which needs could they be expecting the Church to meet? If persons are simply seeking a satisfying social experience, they might be disappointed in a particular ward or branch and seek other associations. There are satisfying social experiences in many organizations. If they are simply seeking help to learn the gospel, they could pursue that goal through available literature. But are these the principal purposes of the Church? Is this all we are to receive from the gospel of Jesus Christ?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/the-gospel-in-our-lives.p7" pid="0rLQAtAJNkGYxrJU6tSs-w" hash="Wxo1BA">Someone has said that what we get depends on what we seek. Persons who attend Church solely in order to <span class="emphasis">get</span> something of a temporal nature may be disappointed. The Apostle Paul wrote disparagingly of persons who “serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/16.18" class="scriptureRef">Rom. 16:18</a>). Persons who attend Church in order to <span class="emphasis">give</span> to their fellowmen and <span class="emphasis">serve</span> the Lord will rarely be disappointed. The Savior promised that “he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/10.39" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 10:39</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/the-gospel-in-our-lives.p8" pid="zftxFaLvNk-Fm75AmH3o6g" hash="muzypg">The Church gives us opportunities to serve the Lord and our fellowmen. If given in the right way and for the right reasons, that service will reward us beyond anything we have given. Millions serve unselfishly and effectively as officers or teachers in Church organizations, and those who do experience the conversion described by the prophet who pleaded with us to “come unto Christ, and be perfected in him” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.32" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 10:32</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/the-gospel-in-our-lives.p9" pid="GxOhgXdYI0ihm_EqEiJKtw" hash="qiH59A">Throughout my life I have been blessed by my membership and participation in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is impossible to describe all the ways the Church has blessed my life and the lives of those I love. But I will give a few examples, in the hope that this will add personal persuasion to the principles described.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/the-gospel-in-our-lives.p10" pid="latQ-gOOTEyCXtD3dyDzcg" hash="JX-Dug">Attendance at Church each week provides the opportunity to partake of the sacrament, as the Lord has commanded us (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.9" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:9</a>). If we act with the right preparation and attitude, partaking of the sacrament renews the cleansing effect of our baptism and qualifies us for the promise that we will always have His Spirit to be with us. A mission of that Spirit, the Holy Ghost, is to testify of the Father and the Son and to lead us into truth (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.26" class="scriptureRef">John 14:26</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.18" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 31:18</a>). Testimony and truth, which are essential to our personal conversion, are the choice harvest of this weekly renewing of our covenants. In the day-to-day decisions of my life and in my personal spiritual growth, I have enjoyed the fulfillment of that promise.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/the-gospel-in-our-lives.p11" pid="B9q-_f7eM0ed93gy1C2_0g" hash="-Y3hng">I am sorry when any Latter-day Saint does not understand the precious blessing that comes to those who keep the commandment to offer up their sacraments upon each Sabbath day. What is there in life—on the lakes or streams, in places of commercial recreation, or at home reading the Sunday paper—that can provide anything comparable to these blessings? No recreational pleasure can equal the cleansing renewal and the spiritual guidance and growth God has promised those who faithfully partake of the sacrament and honor Him each Sabbath day. I give thanks for the fulfillment of those promises in my life and affirm their availability to all.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/the-gospel-in-our-lives.p13" pid="Vu4WJ1kESEuNBYmDvwMF-w" hash="PPuVYQ">As I experienced the death of loved ones, including my father, my mother, and my wife, the comforting revelations of the Holy Ghost gave me the strength to carry on. The Spirit affirms that there is purpose in mortal adversities and gives assurance of the resurrection and the reality of family relationships sealed for eternity.</p>

As taught in the scriptures and by the leaders and teachers of this Church, the gospel has been a light to my path and the impetus for my temporal and spiritual progress. As Brigham Young taught, the gospel laws “teach men to be truthful, honest, chaste, sober, industrious, frugal and to love and practice every good word and work, … they elevate and ennoble man, [and] if fully obeyed, [they] bring health and strength to the body, clearness to the perceptions, power to the reasoning faculties as well as salvation to the soul.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

For me these have included health and knowledge and the capacity to “run and not be weary, and … walk and not faint,” and the fulfillment of the promise that “the destroying angel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/89.18-21" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 89:18–21</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/the-gospel-in-our-lives.p16" pid="pIHoTFjAqEiWShZk5DY8zg" hash="03Pflw">The gospel teaches us to pay our tithes and offerings and assures us of blessings when we do. I testify of the fulfillment of these promises in my life. I have seen the windows of heaven open in my behalf to bestow blessings unnumbered. Among these is the capacity to see the relative unimportance of the property, pride, prominence, and power of this world, in the context of eternity. How grateful I am for the focus and peace that come from a gospel-based understanding of the purpose of life and its relationship to eternity!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/the-gospel-in-our-lives.p17" pid="RP6V1hZ71EaqJ4D4W739JQ" hash="nsJ03Q">From my earliest years and through schooling and marriage to middle age and beyond, the Church has provided me personal associations with the finest people in the world. Teachers and classmates in Sunday School and Primary, in scouting and other youth activities, in quorum and ward and stake activities have given me the finest possible role models and friends. Of course, our Church does not have a monopoly on good people, but we have a remarkable concentration of them. My associations in the organizations of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have given me the basis to recognize, appreciate, and enlarge my associations with people of quality in other churches and organizations.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/the-gospel-in-our-lives.p18" pid="DmMsp73rYUa5TEO56FqR2Q" hash="Vogkkg">Because my father died before I was eight years old, I had early cause to wonder about the purposes of the Lord in depriving me of a relationship other boys enjoyed and took for granted. As with so many other mortal challenges, the perspective of the gospel of Jesus Christ filled that void. How grateful I am that my brother and sister and I were raised by a widowed mother who used her faith and our parents’ temple marriage to make our departed father a daily presence in our lives. We never had cause to feel that we were without a father. We had a father, but he was away for a season. There are few things more important in this life than knowing your place in mortality and your potential in eternity. Marriages sealed for eternity in a temple of the Lord provide that possibility for every child and for every adult.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/the-gospel-in-our-lives.p19" pid="DIxbc_d-50qlnpPzF9OVbQ" hash="MphgFA">Over the years, my active participation in the Church has provided me access to the counsel and inspiration of the leaders of the Church on things I should do as a husband and father and leader in my family. Again and again, in stake and general conferences, in priesthood quorums, and in Sunday School classes, I have been taught and inspired by wonderful and experienced fathers, mothers, and grandparents. I have sought to follow those teachings to improve my participation in those associations that will persist for eternity. To cite only one example, I have been taught the power of a priesthood blessing—not just a blessing of healing, but a blessing of comfort and guidance that a father holding the Melchizedek Priesthood is privileged to give to members of his family. Learning and applying that principle has favored me and my loved ones with the sweetness and closeness that can only come from sensing the significance of the priesthood of God in an eternal family.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/the-gospel-in-our-lives.p20" pid="Aa0sHSzJK0iS72W_5-bO9A" hash="MJazuQ">I am also grateful for the warnings of the scriptures and Church leaders on things to avoid. By following that counsel I have been able to avoid pitfalls that might otherwise have trapped and enslaved me. Alcohol, tobacco, drugs, pornography, and gambling are but a few examples of dangerous substances and addictive practices we have been warned to avoid. I appeal to all—especially to young people—to hear and heed the words of the men and women God has called as your leaders and teachers. You will be blessed if you refrain from setting your own wisdom or desires ahead of the commandments of your Creator and the warnings of His servants.</p>

I urge you to obey those teachings and lay claim on those blessings. They include the personal spiritual conversion—the “mighty change … in our hearts” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.2" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 5:2</a>)—that helps us become what our Heavenly Father desires us to become.</p>

For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.41" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 2:41</a>).</p>

One of the best known was that of President J. Reuben Clark. After over 16 years as an extraordinarily influential first counselor, the First Presidency was reorganized and he was called as second counselor. Offering an example of humility and willingness to serve that has influenced generations, he said to the Church: “In the service of the Lord, it is not where you serve but how. In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, one takes the place to which one is duly called, which place one neither seeks nor declines” (in Conference Report, Apr. 1951, 154).</p>

As an essential part of God’s plan for His children, the leadership and work of His Church is provided by His children who give their time freely for the service of God and their fellowmen. They obey the Lord’s command to love Him and to serve Him (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.15" class="scriptureRef">John 14:15</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.19" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:19</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.29" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 42:29</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.5" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:5</a>).

I wish to apply that teaching to our time.</p>

There are examples throughout the Old and New Testaments. The Apostle Paul wrote, “In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-thes/5.18" class="scriptureRef">1 Thes. 5:18</a>). The prophet Alma taught, “When thou risest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.37" class="scriptureRef">Alma 37:37</a>). And in modern revelation the Lord declared that “he who receiveth all things with thankfulness shall be made glorious; and the things of this earth shall be added unto him, even an hundred fold” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/78.19" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 78:19</a>).</p>

First and foremost, we are thankful for our Savior Jesus Christ. Under the plan of the Father, He created the world. Through His prophets, He revealed the plan of salvation with its accompanying commandments and ordinances. He came into mortality to teach and show us the way. He suffered and paid the price for our sins if we would repent. He gave up His life, and He conquered death and rose from the grave that we all will live again. He is the Light and Life of the World. As King Benjamin taught, if we “should render all the thanks and praise which [our] whole soul has power to possess, to that God who has created [us], and has kept and preserved [us], and … should serve him with all [our] whole souls yet [we] would be unprofitable servants” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.20-21" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 2:20–21</a>).</p>

As the Bible teaches, the Lord gave us apostles and prophets “for the perfecting of the saints” (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/4.11-12" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 4:11–12</a>). We use the revealed truth they give us, “that we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/4.14" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 4:14</a>). Those who view every calamity and measure every new assertion or discovery against the standard of revealed truth need not be “tossed to and fro” but can be steady and at peace. God is in His heavens, and His promises are sure. “Be not troubled,” He has said to us concerning the destructions that will precede the end of the world, “for, when all these things shall come to pass, ye may know that the promises which have been made unto you shall be fulfilled” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.35" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 45:35</a>). What an anchor to the soul in these troubled times!</p>

Speaking at the dedication of his ward chapel, a Filipino bishop expressed his gratitude for the gospel message that came into his life about 10 years ago. He described how it rescued him from a life of selfishness, excess, and abusive practices and made him a good husband and father. He testified of the blessings that had come to him from paying his tithing.</p>

They are evident wherever the gospel message is received and lived. But Sister Oaks and I are profoundly grateful for our opportunity to live and serve in the Philippines, where we have met thousands of wonderful members in new surroundings and seen the gospel in a new light.</p>

We have learned the importance of challenging members to abandon cultural traditions that are contrary to gospel commandments and covenants and to live so that they and their posterity “are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God; … built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/2.19-20" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 2:19–20</a>).</p>

Such people experience “a mighty change” in their hearts, “that [they] have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.2" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 5:2</a>). The image of God is “engraven upon [their] countenances” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.19" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:19</a>). Such followers of Christ are found in every land where the gospel and the Church have been established. We have many of them in the Philippines, and we are working to encourage more of them. We do this by growing from centers of strength, concentrating our teaching where there are sufficiently large groups of committed members to provide the friendshipping, the teachings, the role models, and the needed assistance to the struggling newly born members who are just learning what the gospel asks of us and gives to us.</p>

The Lord taught the prophet Moroni, “I give unto men weakness that they may be humble,” and then promised that “if they humble themselves … and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.27" class="scriptureRef">Ether 12:27</a>). In the midst of the persecutions the Latter-day Saints were suffering in Missouri, the Lord gave a similar teaching and promise: “Verily I say unto you my friends, fear not, let your hearts be comforted; yea, rejoice evermore, and in everything give thanks; … and all things wherewith you have been afflicted shall work together for your good” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98.1,3" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 98:1, 3</a>). And to Joseph Smith in the afflictions of Liberty Jail, the Lord said, “Know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 122:7</a>). Brigham Young understood. Said he, “There is not a single condition of life [or] one hour’s experience but what is beneficial to all those who make it their study, and aim to improve upon the experience they gain” (<span class="emphasis">Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Brigham Young</span> [1997], 179).</p>

We call it suffering. I call it a school of experience. … I have never looked at these things in any other light than trials for the purpose of purifying the Saints of God that they may be, as the scriptures say, as gold that has been seven times purified by the fire” (<span class="emphasis">Teachings of Presidents of the Church: John Taylor</span> [2001], 203). Pioneers like President John Taylor, who witnessed the murder of their prophet and experienced prolonged persecution and incredible hardships for their faith, praised God and thanked Him. Through their challenges and the courageous and inspired actions they took to meet them, they grew in faith and in spiritual stature. Through their afflictions they became what God desired them to become, and they laid the foundation of the great work that blesses our lives today.</p>

The greatest affliction of her life was the death of her husband, our father, after only 11 years of marriage. This changed her life and imposed great hardships as she proceeded to earn a living and raise her three little children alone. Nevertheless, I often heard her say that the Lord consecrated that affliction for her gain because her husband’s death compelled her to develop her talents and serve and become something that she could never have become without that seeming tragedy. Our mother was a spiritual giant, strong and fully worthy of the loving tribute her three children inscribed on her headstone: “Her Faith Strengthened All.”</p>

His courage, his submissive attitude in accepting his affliction with cancer, and his stalwart continued service have ministered comfort to thousands and taught eternal principles to millions. His example shows that the Lord will not only consecrate our afflictions for our gain, but He will use them to bless the lives of countless others.</p>

The memorial also honors over 36,000 other servicemen who also lost their lives but whose bodies were never recovered.

But when I felt the warm embrace of the Savior, I wanted to serve Him, and I changed.” Yes he did! Stanley Y. Q. Ho told me that until he was 30 years old he did nothing but “hang around the beaches at Waikiki.” Then he found the gospel, he married a Latter-day Saint girl, and he changed. Since then he has fulfilled many callings, including bishop and stake president. Now, Elder Ho and his beloved Momi, who is responsible for so many of the changes in his life, have served three full-time missions.</p>

The purpose of the gospel is to transform common creatures into celestial citizens, and that requires change.</p>

When the scribes and Pharisees complained that His disciples “transgress[ed] the tradition of the elders” by omitting the ritual washings, Jesus replied that the scribes and Pharisees “transgress[ed] the commandment of God by [their] tradition” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/15.2-3" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 15:2–3</a>). He described how they had “made the commandment of God of none effect by [their] tradition” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/15.6" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 15:6</a>). “Hypocrites” is what He called those whose adherence to their traditions kept them from keeping the commandments of God (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/15.7" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 15:7</a>).</p>

Always the prophets of God have condemned whoredoms. Yet these eternal commands have frequently been ignored, opposed, or mocked by powerful traditions in many lands. This is especially visible today, when the movies, magazines, and Internet communications of one nation are instantly shared with many others. Sexual relations out of wedlock are tolerated or advocated by many. So is the rapidly expanding culture of pornography. All who have belonged to these cultures of sin must repent and change if they are to become the people of God, for He has warned that “no unclean thing can enter into his kingdom” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.19" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 27:19</a>).</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/repentance-and-change.p23" pid="cUvqwKp-EEiXnc2fs9HsiA" hash="gamzhA">Weekly attendance at church is another example of a commandment contrary to popular traditions. The Lord has commanded us to attend church and “offer up [our] sacraments” on His Sabbath day (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.9" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:9</a>). This requires more than passive attendance. We are commanded to participate in worship and in service, and that requires a wrenching change for many non-Christians and even for those Christians who have attended church only as irregular spectators.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/repentance-and-change.p24" pid="Khnbkwk0TUyGfkjuYY-sNQ" hash="jJHsHw">The Lord’s command that we abstain from alcohol, tobacco, tea, and coffee (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/89.title" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 89</a>) also runs counter to the traditions of many. Long-standing addictions or habits are not easily broken, but God’s command is clear, and the promised blessings more than compensate for the challenges of change.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/repentance-and-change.p25" pid="XY_DrAtSGEGOdcfJy9XBvQ" hash="iNWiRA">Another example is honesty. Some cultures allow lying, stealing, and other dishonest practices. But dishonesty in any form—whether to appease, to save face, or to get gain—is in direct conflict with gospel commandments and culture. God is a God of truth, and God does not change. We are the ones who must change. And that will be a big change for all whose traditions accustom them to thinking that they can lie a little, cheat a little, or engage in deceit whenever it brings personal advantage and is not likely to be detected.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/repentance-and-change.p26" pid="AotAqYzU_E-RxmNZaFZSuA" hash="UI4WpQ">A less serious worldly tradition that conflicts with gospel culture is the idea of upward or downward movement in positions. In the world, we refer to the up or down of promotions or reductions. But there is no up or down in Church positions. We just move around. A bishop released by proper authority and called to teach in Primary does not move down. He moves forward as he accepts his release with gratitude and fulfills the duties of a new calling—even one far less visible.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/repentance-and-change.p27" pid="csQjOD2PkEmbkhNZbpE9SQ" hash="EFyNbg">I saw a memorable example of this a few months ago in the Philippines. I visited a ward in the Pasig stake, near Manila. There I met Augusto Lim, whom I had known in earlier years as a stake president, a mission president, a General Authority, and president of the Manila temple. Now I saw him serving humbly and gratefully in his ward bishopric, second counselor to a man much younger and much less experienced. From temple president to second counselor in a ward bishopric is a beautiful example of the gospel culture in action.</p>

I am contrasting the Lord’s way with the world’s way—the culture of the gospel of Jesus Christ with the culture or traditions of every nation or people. No group has a monopoly on virtue or an immunity from the commandment to change. Jesus and His Apostles did not attempt to make Gentiles into Jews (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/2.11" class="scriptureRef">Rom. 2:11</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/gal/2.11-16" class="scriptureRef">Gal. 2:11–16</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/gal/3.1-29" class="scriptureRef">Gal. 3:1–29</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/gal/5.1-6" class="scriptureRef">Gal. 5:1–6</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/gal/6.15" class="scriptureRef">Gal. 6:15</a>).

The Savior invites all to come unto Him (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.33" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 26:33</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/43.20" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 43:20</a>), and His servants seek to persuade all—including Americans—to become Latter-day Saints. We say to all, give up your traditions and cultural practices that are contrary to the commandments of God and the culture of His gospel, and join with His people in building the kingdom of God. If we cease to walk in darkness, the Apostle John taught, “we walk in the light, … we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-jn/1.7" class="scriptureRef">1 Jn. 1:7</a>).</p>

This requirement of individual responsibility, which has many expressions in our doctrine, is in sharp contrast to Satan’s plan to “redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost “ (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.1" class="scriptureRef">Moses 4:1</a>).

We live in a world where there are large differences in income and material possessions and where there are many public and private efforts to narrow these differences. The followers of the Savior are commanded to give to the poor, and many do. But some gifts have promoted a culture of dependency, reducing their recipients’ need for earthly food or shelter but impoverishing them in their eternal need for individual growth. The growth required by the gospel plan only occurs in a culture of individual effort and responsibility. It cannot occur in a culture of dependency. Whatever causes us to be dependent on someone else for decisions or resources we could provide for ourselves weakens us spiritually and retards our growth toward what the gospel plan intends us to be.</p>

That is the lesson to be learned from the children of Israel, who came out of hundreds of years of slavery in Egypt and followed a prophet into their own land and became a mighty people. That lesson can also be learned from the Mormon pioneers, who never used their persecutions or poverty as an excuse but went forward in faith, knowing that God would bless them when they kept His commandments, which He did.</p>

The Apostle John warned that this will cause the world to hate us (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-jn/3.13" class="scriptureRef">1 Jn. 3:13</a>). That is why those who have made the covenant to change have a sacred duty to love and help one another. That encouragement must be extended to every soul who struggles to come out of the culture of the world and into the culture of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

(3) No one knows the time of His coming, but (4) the faithful are taught to study the signs of it and to be prepared for it. I wish to speak about the fourth of these great realities: the signs of the Second Coming and what we should do to prepare for it.</p>

In the early years of this last dispensation, a gathering to Zion involved various locations in the United States: to Kirtland, to Missouri, to Nauvoo, and to the tops of the mountains. Always these were gatherings to prospective temples. With the creation of stakes and the construction of temples in most nations with sizeable populations of the faithful, the current commandment is not to gather to one place but to gather in stakes in our own homelands. There the faithful can enjoy the full blessings of eternity in a house of the Lord. There, in their own homelands, they can obey the Lord’s command to enlarge the borders of His people and strengthen her stakes (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.21" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 101:21</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/133.9,14" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 133:9, 14</a>).

To borrow a metaphor from the familiar world of athletic competitions, we do not know when this game will end, and we do not know the final score, but we do know that when the game finally ends, our team wins. We will continue to go forward “till the purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 4:540).</p>

The Apostle Paul wrote that when he was a child he understood as a child, but when he became a man he put away such things (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13.11" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 13:11</a>).

Along the road there are many signs that beckon. Satan is the author of some of these invitations. He seeks to confuse and deceive us, to get us on a low road that leads away from our eternal destination.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/be-not-deceived.p4" pid="fQaKvV55LUmyoLdozi1Yfw" hash="FuUKfQ">In the beginning, when a powerful spirit was cast down for rebellion, “he became Satan, … the devil, the father of all lies, to deceive and to blind men, and to lead them captive at his will” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.4" class="scriptureRef">Moses 4:4</a>). He and the spirits who follow him are still deceiving the world. Modern revelation declares that “Satan hath sought to deceive you, that he might overthrow you” (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/50.2-3" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 50:2–3</a>). Satan’s methods of deception are enticing: music, movies and other media, and the glitter of a good time. When Satan’s lies succeed in deceiving us, we become vulnerable to his power.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/be-not-deceived.p5" pid="i28e8jKxqkaavLp6mkwa3A" hash="XyDZ1g">Here are some ways the devil will try to deceive us. God’s commandments and the teachings of His prophets warn against each of them.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/be-not-deceived.p6" pid="U-mL6iDEnEaGmoPK8WJxuw" hash="YpL54w">1. One kind of deception seeks to mislead us about whom we should follow. In speaking of the last days, the Savior taught: “Take heed that no man deceive you. For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/24.4-5" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 24:4–5</a>). In other words, many will seek to deceive us by saying that they or their teachings will save us, so there is no need for a Savior or His gospel. The Book of Mormon describes this as “the power of the devil, to lead away and deceive the hearts of the people … to believe that the doctrine of Christ was a foolish and a vain thing” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/2.2" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 2:2</a>).</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/be-not-deceived.p7" pid="G2LaJFadeEeX0oX8h9DhUw" hash="-dKK4Q">2. Satan also seeks to deceive us about right and wrong and persuade us that there is no such thing as sin. This detour typically starts off with what seems to be only a small departure: “Just try it once. One beer or one cigarette or one porno movie won’t hurt.” What all of these departures have in common is that each of them is addictive. Addiction is a condition in which we surrender part of our power of choice. When we do that we give the devil power over us. The prophet Nephi described where this leads: the devil says, “There is no hell,” and, “I am no devil, for there is none—and thus he whispereth in their ears, until he grasps them with his awful chains, from whence there is no deliverance” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.22" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 28:22</a>).</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/be-not-deceived.p8" pid="RyC-pGZtdEa5Z1HwQGJSsg" hash="Aj6qfA">If we choose the wrong road, we choose the wrong destination. For example, a friend of many years told me that her husband, always a “good kid” in high school, took a few drinks he thought would help him forget some problems. Before he knew what was happening, he was addicted. Now he is not able to support his family, and he is ineffective at almost everything he tries to do. Alcohol governs his life, and he cannot seem to break free of its grip.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/be-not-deceived.p9" pid="RQ2H1bRUVkSFJnga-l5zSA" hash="UOix1w">3. The prophet Nephi warns against another kind of deception: “And others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal security, that they will say: All is well in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well—and thus the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.21" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 28:21</a>).</p>

They are confident in their own prosperity and conclude that God must have accepted their chosen route.</p>

They will come at you in classrooms and hallways, in what you read, and in what you see in popular entertainment. Many in the world deny the need for a Savior. Others deny that there is any right or wrong, and they scoff at the idea of sin or a devil. Still others rely on the mercy of God and ignore His justice. The prophet said, “There shall be many which shall teach after this manner, false and vain and foolish doctrines” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.9" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 28:9</a>).</p>

He also said that “evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-tim/3.13" class="scriptureRef">2 Tim. 3:13</a>). In a moment I will discuss what Paul told young Timothy about how to avoid this wickedness.</p>

Heed the ancient and modern prophetic warnings against thievery, drunkenness, and all forms of sexual sin. The deceiver seeks to destroy your spirituality by all of these means. Paul warns us against those who “lie in wait to deceive … by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/4.14" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 4:14</a>). Beware of the slick package and the glitz of a good time. What the devil portrays as fun can be spiritually fatal.</p>

We hear of prominent officials who have lied about their secret acts. We learn of honored sports heroes who have lied about gambling on the outcome of their games or using drugs to enhance their performance. We see less well-known persons engaging in evil acts in secret they would never do in public. Perhaps they think no one will ever know. But God always knows. And He has repeatedly warned that the time will come when “[our] iniquities shall be spoken upon the housetops, and [our] secret acts shall be revealed” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.3" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:3</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/morm/5.8" class="scriptureRef">Morm. 5:8</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 38:7</a>).</p>

For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/gal/6.7-8" class="scriptureRef">Gal. 6:7–8</a>).</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/be-not-deceived.p22" pid="zlnj-wOYf0WwVIV0MYdjqA" hash="fmb6Pg">In other words, if we indulge in drugs or pornography or other evils that the Apostle called sowing to the flesh, eternal law dictates that we harvest corruption rather than life eternal. That is the justice of God, and mercy cannot rob justice. If an eternal law is broken, the punishment affixed to that law must be suffered. Some of this can be satisfied by the Savior’s Atonement, but the merciful cleansing of a soiled sinner comes only after repentance (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/42.22-25" class="scriptureRef">Alma 42:22–25</a>), which for some sins is a prolonged and painful process. Otherwise, “he that exercises no faith unto repentance is exposed to the whole law of the demands of justice; therefore only unto him that has faith unto repentance is brought about the great and eternal plan of redemption” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.16" class="scriptureRef">Alma 34:16</a>).</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/be-not-deceived.p23" pid="TWdvqBOICkGvWqZUxXwlUQ" hash="u6MI-g">Fortunately, repentance is possible. For the most serious sins we need to confess to our bishop and seek his loving help. For other sins it may be sufficient for us to confess to the Lord and to whomever we have wronged. Most lying is of this sort. If you have deceived someone, resolve now to stop carrying the burden. Make it right and get on with your life.</p>

I have two texts. The first is what Paul taught Timothy after giving him the warning I quoted earlier. Continue in the things you have learned and been assured of, he wrote, “knowing of whom thou hast learned them” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-tim/3.14" class="scriptureRef">2 Tim. 3:14</a>). In other words, you have been taught righteousness and assured of its truth, so stay with it. Continuing, Paul reminded his young friend “that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation” through faith in our Savior (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-tim/3.15" class="scriptureRef">2 Tim. 3:15</a>).

The Apostle James wrote, “Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/1.22" class="scriptureRef">James 1:22</a>). King Benjamin taught, “And now, if you believe all these things see that ye do them” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.10" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 4:10</a>). And in modern revelation the Lord declares, “If you will that I give unto you a place in the celestial world, you must prepare yourselves by doing the things which I have commanded you and required of you” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/78.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 78:7</a>).</p>

We must take the high road by acting upon that knowledge. It is not enough to know that President Gordon B. Hinckley is God’s prophet. We must put his teachings to work in our lives. It is not enough to have a calling. We must fulfill our responsibilities. The things taught in this conference are not just to fill our minds. They are to motivate and guide our actions.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/pornography.p1" pid="7FeKqmuU_EuGZtc6wKPG0A" hash="f7ASXQ">Last summer Sister Oaks and I returned from two years in the Philippines. We loved our service there, and we loved returning home. When we have been away, we see our surroundings in a new light, with increased appreciation and sometimes with new concerns.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/pornography.p2" pid="uwboAXLVZ06r-CtIHej0ug" hash="tk-GKQ">We were concerned to see the inroads pornography had made in the United States while we were away. For many years our Church leaders have warned against the dangers of images and words intended to arouse sexual desires. Now the corrupting influence of pornography, produced and disseminated for commercial gain, is sweeping over our society like an avalanche of evil.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/pornography.p3" pid="ga3lTsi7ekSlrqTUw7QT4w" hash="dTygeA">At our last conference, President Gordon B. Hinckley devoted an entire talk to this subject, warning in the plainest terms that “this is a very serious problem even among us” (“A Tragic Evil among Us,” <span class="emphasis">Liahona</span> and <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 2004, 61). Most of the bishops we meet in stake conferences now report major concerns with this problem.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/pornography.p4" pid="SdKMI9fq3kGB3hWyhRarCw" hash="rDcEUg">My fellow holders of the Melchizedek Priesthood, and also our young men, I wish to speak to you today about pornography. I know that many of you are exposed to this and that many of you are being stained by it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/pornography.p5" pid="GwGd-bNQl0uhnrOJxycRfg" hash="q3rvyg">In concentrating my talk on this subject I feel like the prophet Jacob, who told the men of his day that it grieved him to speak so boldly in front of their sensitive wives and children. But notwithstanding the difficulty of the task, he said he had to speak to the men about this subject because God had commanded him (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2.7-11" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 2:7–11</a>). I do so for the same reason.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/pornography.p6" pid="APUEgt9_J0WriaJF9BmxTw" hash="zVWrzQ">In the second chapter of the book that bears his name, Jacob condemns men for their “whoredoms” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2.23,28" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 2:23, 28</a>). He told them they had “broken the hearts of [their] tender wives, and lost the confidence of [their] children, because of [their] bad examples before them” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2.35" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 2:35</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/pornography.p7" pid="l6hqhrXPi02ZQHmn_AuiEw" hash="mcs5Xg">What were these grossly wicked “whoredoms”? No doubt some men were already guilty of evil acts. But the main focus of Jacob’s great sermon was not with evil acts <span class="emphasis">completed,</span> but with evil acts <span class="emphasis">contemplated.</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/pornography.p8" pid="cWtxXgMNukalA5VnDQFWuA" hash="q9Ymig">Jacob began his sermon by telling the men that “as yet, [they had] been obedient unto the word of the Lord” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2.4" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 2:4</a>). However, he then told them he knew their thoughts, that they were “beginning to labor in sin, which sin appeareth very abominable … unto God” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2.5" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 2:5</a>). “I must testify unto you concerning the wickedness of your hearts” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2.6" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 2:6</a>), he added. Jacob was speaking as Jesus spoke when He said, “Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.28" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 5:28</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.28" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 12:28</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:6</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/63.16" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 63:16</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/pornography.p9" pid="3EzYnz6uz0WW9ZEtxZ7GDg" hash="7_G7RQ">More than 30 years ago, I urged BYU students to avoid the “promotional literature of illicit sexual relations” in what they read and viewed. I gave this analogy:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/pornography.p10" pid="jxm6YaKoaEKyZc-WjUKNlA" hash="VnLjRw">“Pornographic or erotic stories and pictures are worse than filthy or polluted food. The body has defenses to rid itself of unwholesome food. With a few fatal exceptions, bad food will only make you sick but do no permanent harm. In contrast, a person who feasts upon filthy stories or pornographic or erotic pictures and literature records them in this marvelous retrieval system we call a brain. The brain won’t vomit back filth. Once recorded, it will always remain subject to recall, flashing its perverted images across your mind and drawing you away from the wholesome things in life.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/pornography.p11" pid="rm03HGqgtEGJI-hiZIslAg" hash="_OJBdA">Here, brethren, I must tell you that our bishops and our professional counselors are seeing an increasing number of men involved with pornography, and many of those are active members. Some involved in pornography apparently minimize its seriousness and continue to exercise the priesthood of God because they think no one will know of their involvement. But the user knows, brethren, and so does the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/pornography.p12" pid="g9D1v585_UO-44jm-Fyf0w" hash="_IpA_Q">Some have suggested that pornography should be a separate question in the temple recommend interview. It is already. At least five different questions should elicit a confession and discussion on this subject if the person being interviewed has the spiritual sensitivity and honesty we expect of those who worship in the house of the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/pornography.p13" pid="nX6c672PD0GRPZcT6jOJnQ" hash="oXZYVA">One of the Savior’s most memorable teachings applies to men who are secretly viewing pornography:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/pornography.p14" pid="X6Nd-zzjBEmclmGmtC9HWQ" hash="OSNJCg">“Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/pornography.p15" pid="ta4rA5c5dkqoUvY3QkjCIw" hash="PPEn4g">“Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/23.25-26" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 23:25–26</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/60.23" class="scriptureRef">Alma 60:23</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/pornography.p16" pid="em75rH18iE-X9P35RLuDuw" hash="O1m_zw">The Savior continues His denunciation of those who treat what is visible but neglect to cleanse the inner man:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/pornography.p17" pid="q4flLigKtE-3XxTPBS5P8w" hash="OKm6yQ">“Ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men’s bones, and of all uncleanness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/pornography.p18" pid="QGaHsIiiaUa5vp0puhHrmg" hash="wyPXfw">“Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/23.27-28" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 23:27–28</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/pornography.p19" pid="gBn4Ef50iECORuit56ydHg" hash="kc8rQA">The immediate spiritual consequences of such hypocrisy are devastating. Those who seek out and use pornography forfeit the power of their priesthood. The Lord declares: “When we undertake to cover our sins, … behold, the heavens withdraw themselves; the Spirit of the Lord is grieved; and when it is withdrawn, Amen to the priesthood or the authority of that man” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.37" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:37</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/pornography.p20" pid="hN5LXkFIFEuJJBeoDtUiig" hash="0YzFXg">Patrons of pornography also lose the companionship of the Spirit. Pornography produces fantasies that destroy spirituality. “To be carnally minded is death”—spiritual death (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/8.6" class="scriptureRef">Rom. 8:6</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.39" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 9:39</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/pornography.p21" pid="QNKec-LhgkmF70uudnLpgw" hash="jErdzw">The scriptures repeatedly teach that the Spirit of the Lord will not dwell in an unclean tabernacle. When we worthily partake of the sacrament, we are promised that we will “always have his Spirit to be with [us].” To qualify for that promise we covenant that we will “always remember him” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.77" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:77</a>). Those who seek out and use pornography for sexual stimulation obviously violate that covenant. They also violate a sacred covenant to refrain from unholy and impure practices. They cannot have the Spirit of the Lord to be with them. All such need to heed the Apostle Peter’s plea: “Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/8.22" class="scriptureRef">Acts 8:22</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/pornography.p22" pid="G2vc0ot-x0CMSahoRN74LA" hash="XUeEDg">Brethren, you have noticed that I am not discussing the effects of pornography on mental health or criminal behavior. I am discussing its effects on spirituality—on our ability to have the companionship of the Spirit of the Lord and our capacity to exercise the power of the priesthood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/pornography.p23" pid="Gp2MgE0rpUiPWdMbzG6DCg" hash="1wIDVQ">Pornography also inflicts mortal wounds on our most precious personal relationships. In his talk to men of the priesthood last October, President Hinckley quoted the letter of a woman who asked him to warn Church members that pornography “has the effect of damaging hearts and souls to their very depths, strangling the life out of relationships” (<span class="emphasis">Liahona</span> and <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 2004, 60).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/pornography.p24" pid="UJ4XTCVerUyakXlJRWSvAA" hash="mcnveQ">At a recent stake conference a woman handed me a similar letter. Her husband had also served in important Church callings for many years while addicted to pornography. She told of great difficulty in getting priesthood leaders to take this problem of pornography seriously: “I got all kinds of responses—like I was overreacting or it was my fault. The bishop we have now has been great. And now after 15 years my husband is trying to deal with his addiction, but now it is 15 years harder to quit for him and the loss has been incalculable.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/pornography.p25" pid="MmJZefWo2UqwyZ-SOjMcfw" hash="a04mVg">Pornography impairs one’s ability to enjoy a normal emotional, romantic, and spiritual relationship with a person of the opposite sex. It erodes the moral barriers that stand against inappropriate, abnormal, or illegal behavior. As conscience is desensitized, patrons of pornography are led to act out what they have witnessed, regardless of its effects on their life and the lives of others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/pornography.p26" pid="vA3lkh2jFku31izc3j-d5A" hash="r2znAg">Pornography is also addictive. It impairs decision-making capacities and it “hooks” its users, drawing them back obsessively for more and more. A man who had been addicted to pornography and to hard drugs wrote me this comparison: “In my eyes cocaine doesn’t hold a candle to this. I have done both. … Quitting even the hardest drugs was nothing compared to [trying to quit pornography]” (letter of Mar. 20, 2005).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/pornography.p27" pid="0aurifTj-UCWEJVLPjzhzA" hash="wSYtXQ">Some seek to justify their indulgence by arguing that they are only viewing “soft,” not “hard,” porn. A wise bishop called this refusing to see evil as evil. He quoted men seeking to justify their viewing choices by comparisons such as “not as bad as” or “only one bad scene.” But the test of what is evil is not its degree but its effect. When persons entertain evil thoughts long enough for the Spirit to withdraw, they lose their spiritual protection and they are subject to the power and direction of the evil one. When they use Internet or other pornography for what this bishop described as “arousal on demand” (letter of Mar. 13, 2005), they are deeply soiled by sin.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/pornography.p28" pid="JKA83uLRXk25--NntSdIVw" hash="MJwSgA">King Benjamin’s great sermon describes the terrible consequences. When we withdraw from the Spirit of the Lord, we become an enemy to righteousness, we have a lively sense of our guilt, and we “shrink from the presence of the Lord” (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.36-38" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 2:36–38</a>). “Mercy hath no claim on that man,” he concluded; “therefore his final doom is to endure a never-ending torment” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.39" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 2:39</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/pornography.p29" pid="Fl6SuoktuEe9Mq-Nq8nb7A" hash="VfM_hg">Consider the tragic example of King David. Though a spiritual giant in Israel, he allowed himself to look upon something he should not have viewed (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/2-sam/11.title" class="scriptureRef">2 Sam. 11</a>). Tempted by what he saw, he violated two of the Ten Commandments, beginning with “Thou shalt not commit adultery” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/20.14" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 20:14</a>). In this way a prophet-king fell from his exaltation (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.39" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 132:39</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/pornography.p30" pid="Sd_cET6xxUC1kjKfexUOwg" hash="94yIzg">But the good news is that no one needs to follow the evil, downward descent to torment. Everyone caught on that terrible escalator has the key to reverse his course. He can escape. Through repentance he can be clean.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/pornography.p31" pid="cx_YFSSGU0Oc7AjrG5BD2Q" hash="mdAHxw">Alma the Younger described it:</p>

        <span class="emphasis">First,</span> acknowledge the evil. Don’t defend it or try to justify yourself.

        <span class="emphasis">Third,</span> do all that you can to avoid pornography. If you ever find yourself in its presence—which can happen to anyone in the world in which we live—follow the example of Joseph of Egypt.

Remember your covenants and be faithful in temple attendance. The wise bishop I quoted earlier reported that “an endowed priesthood bearer’s fall into pornography <span class="emphasis">never</span> occurs during periods of regular worship in the temple; it happens when he has become casual in his temple worship” (letter of Mar. 13, 2005).</p>

I was the oldest of three small children our widowed mother struggled to raise. When I was ordained a deacon, she said how pleased she was to have a priesthood holder in the home. But Mother continued to direct the family, including calling on which one of us would pray when we knelt together each morning. I was puzzled. I had been taught that the priesthood presided in the family. There must be something I didn’t know about how that principle worked.</p>

He roared like a lion, and she cowered like a lamb. When they walked to church, she always walked a few steps behind him. That made my mother mad. She was a strong woman who would not accept such domination, and she was angry to see another woman abused in that way. I think of her reaction whenever I see men misusing their authority to gratify their pride or exercise control or compulsion upon their wives in any degree of unrighteousness (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.37" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:37</a>).</p>

Mindful of their partnership relationship with their husband in the family, some wives have sought to extend that relationship to their husband’s priesthood calling, such as bishop or mission president. In contrast, some single women who have been abused by men (such as in a divorce) mistakenly confuse the priesthood with male abuse and become suspicious of any priesthood authority. A person who has had a bad experience with a particular electrical appliance should not forego using the power of electricity.</p>

This principle is understood and applied by the great Church and family leaders I have known, but it is rarely explained. Even the scriptures, which record various exercises of priesthood authority, seldom state expressly which principles only apply to the exercise of priesthood authority in the family or in the Church or which apply in both of them.</p>

The family is dependent upon the Church for doctrine, ordinances, and priesthood keys. The Church provides the teachings, authority, and ordinances necessary to perpetuate family relationships to the eternities.</p>

Each is so interrelated that service to one is service to the other. When children see their parents faithfully perform Church callings, it strengthens their family relationships. When families are strong, the Church is strong. The two run in parallel. Each is important and necessary, and each must be conducted with careful concern for the other. Church programs and activities should not be so all-encompassing that families cannot have everyone present for family time. And family activities should not be scheduled in conflict with sacrament meeting or other vital Church meetings.</p>

If all families were complete and perfect, the Church could sponsor fewer activities. But in a world where many of our youth grow up in homes where one parent is missing, not a member, or otherwise inactive in gospel leadership, there is a special need for Church activities to fill in the gaps. Our widowed mother wisely saw that Church activities would provide her sons with experiences she could not provide because we had no male role model in the home. I remember her urging me to watch and try to be like the good men in our ward. She pushed me to participate in Scouting and other Church activities that would provide this opportunity.</p>

The priesthood is the power of God used to bless all of His children, male and female. Some of our abbreviated expressions, like “the women and the priesthood,” convey an erroneous idea. Men are not “the priesthood.” Priesthood meeting is a meeting of those who hold and exercise the priesthood. The blessings of the priesthood, such as baptism, receiving the Holy Ghost, the temple endowment, and eternal marriage, are available to men and women alike. The authority of the priesthood functions in the family and in the Church, according to the principles the Lord has established.</p>

          <span class="strong">
  <span class="emphasis">Keys.</span>
</span> One important difference between its function in the Church and in the family is the fact that all priesthood authority <span class="emphasis">in the Church</span> functions under the direction of the one who holds the appropriate priesthood keys. In contrast, the authority that presides <span class="emphasis">in the family</span>—whether father or single-parent mother—functions in family matters without the need to get authorization from anyone holding priesthood keys. This family authority includes directing the activities of the family, family meetings like family home evenings, family prayer, teaching the gospel, and counseling and disciplining family members. It also includes ordained fathers giving priesthood blessings.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/priesthood-authority-in-the-family-and-the-church.p14" pid="QfcWRucBmkms9TTi-4cdJg" hash="hOxWMA">However, priesthood keys are necessary to authorize the ordaining or setting apart of family members. This is because the organization the Lord has made responsible for the performance and recording of priesthood ordinances is the Church, not the family.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/priesthood-authority-in-the-family-and-the-church.p15" pid="56vE4l45skOHNTg9r0NztQ" hash="bqUZLQ">
          <span class="strong">
  <span class="emphasis">Boundaries.</span>
</span> Church organizations like wards, quorums, or auxiliaries always have geographic boundaries that limit the responsibility and authority of the callings associated with them. In contrast, family relationships and responsibilities are not dependent upon where different family members reside.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/priesthood-authority-in-the-family-and-the-church.p16" pid="QqCiH8g1kk218D_405w-Zw" hash="sE2qtg">
          <span class="strong">
  <span class="emphasis">Duration.</span>
</span> Church callings are always temporary, but family relationships are permanent.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/priesthood-authority-in-the-family-and-the-church.p17" pid="wqiiieJ7wE-YFxpsFpB6Bw" hash="dIoh_g">
          <span class="strong">
  <span class="emphasis">Call and release.</span>
</span> Another contrast concerns the initiation and termination of positions. In the Church, a priesthood leader who holds the necessary keys has the authority to call or release persons serving under his direction. He can even cause that they lose their membership and have their names “blotted out” (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/26.34-38" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 26:34–38</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.56-62" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:56–62</a>). In contrast, family relationships are so important that the head of the family lacks the authority to make changes in family membership. That can only be done by someone authorized to adjust family relationships under the laws of man or the laws of God. Thus, while a bishop can <span class="emphasis">release</span> a Relief Society president, he cannot sever his relationship with his wife without a <span class="emphasis">divorce</span> under the laws of man. Again, his sealing for eternity cannot be ended without a cancellation procedure under the laws of God. Similarly, a youth serving in a class or quorum presidency can be <span class="emphasis">released</span> by priesthood authority in the ward, but parents cannot <span class="emphasis">divorce</span> a child whose life choices are offensive to them. Family relationships are more enduring than Church relationships.</p>

          <span class="strong">
  <span class="emphasis">Partnership.</span>
</span> A most important difference in the functioning of priesthood authority in the family and in the Church results from the fact that the government of the family is patriarchal, whereas the government of the Church is hierarchical. The concept of partnership functions differently in the family than in the Church.</p>

She does not now experience priesthood authority in the partnership relationship of marriage. Her experiences with priesthood authority are in the hierarchical relationships of the Church, and some single women feel they have no voice in those relationships. It is, therefore, imperative to have an effective ward council, where male and female ward officers sit down together regularly to counsel under the presiding authority of the bishop.</p>

In the first chapter Father Lehi praises the Lord, whose “power, and goodness, and mercy are over all the inhabitants of the earth” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/1.14" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 1:14</a>). Again and again the Book of Mormon teaches that the gospel of Jesus Christ is universal in its promise and effect, reaching out to all who ever live on the earth. Here are some examples, quoted directly from that book:</p>

He caused the blind to see; the deaf to hear; the palsied, withered, or maimed to be restored; lepers to be cleansed; and unclean spirits to be cast out. Often we read that the person healed of these physical ailments was “made whole” (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/14.36" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 14:36</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/15.28" class="scriptureRef">15:28</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/6.56" class="scriptureRef">Mark 6:56</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/10.52" class="scriptureRef">10:52</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/17.19" class="scriptureRef">Luke 17:19</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/5.9" class="scriptureRef">John 5:9</a>).</p>

Matthew writes that He healed every sickness and every disease among the people (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/4.23" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 4:23</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/9.35" class="scriptureRef">9:35</a>). Great multitudes followed Him, and He “healed them all” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/12.15" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 12:15</a>). Surely these healings included those whose sicknesses were emotional, mental, or spiritual. He healed them all.</p>

As Jesus declared that He was come to fulfill that prophecy, He expressly affirmed that He would heal those with physical ailments and He would also deliver the captive, liberate the bruised, and heal the brokenhearted.</p>

It tells of the time when “great multitudes came together to hear [Jesus], and to be healed by him of their infirmities” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/5.15" class="scriptureRef">Luke 5:15</a>). On other occasions it records that Jesus “cured many of their infirmities” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/7.21" class="scriptureRef">Luke 7:21</a>) and that He “healed them that had need of healing” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/9.11" class="scriptureRef">Luke 9:11</a>). It also describes how a great multitude of people out of Judea and Jerusalem and the seacoast of Sidon came down to the plain “to hear him, and to be healed” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/6.17" class="scriptureRef">Luke 6:17</a>).</p>

He extended the same invitation to those “that are afflicted in any manner” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17.7" class="scriptureRef">3 Nephi 17:7</a>). “Bring them hither,” He said, “and I will heal them” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17.7" class="scriptureRef">v. 7</a>). The Book of Mormon tells how the multitude brought forward “all them that were afflicted in any manner” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17.9" class="scriptureRef">v. 9</a>). This must have included persons with every kind of physical or emotional or mental affliction, and the scripture testifies that Jesus “did heal them every one” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17.9" class="scriptureRef">v. 9</a>).</p>

His Atonement reaches and is <span class="pageBreak" page-number="7"></span>powerful enough not only to pay the price for sin but also to heal every mortal affliction. The Book of Mormon teaches that “He shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.11" class="scriptureRef">Alma 7:11</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.21" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 9:21</a>).</p>

Mortal exercises of that authority are limited by the will of Him whose priesthood it is. Consequently, we are told that some whom the elders bless are not healed because they are “appointed unto death” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.48" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 42:48</a>). Similarly, when the Apostle Paul sought to be healed from the “thorn in the flesh” that buffeted him (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-cor/12.7" class="scriptureRef">2 Corinthians 12:7</a>), the Lord declined to heal him. Paul later wrote that the Lord explained, “My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-cor/12.9" class="scriptureRef">v. 9</a>). Paul obediently responded that he would “rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me … for when I am weak, then am I strong” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-cor/12.9-10" class="scriptureRef">vv. 9–10</a>).</p>

This is a sensitive subject because it evokes such strong emotions from persons it has touched in different ways. Some see themselves or their loved ones as the <span class="emphasis">victims</span> of divorce. Others see themselves as its <span class="emphasis">beneficiaries.</span> Some see divorce as evidence of failure. Others consider it an essential escape hatch from marriage. In one way or another, divorce touches most families in the Church.</p>

        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/divorce.p4" pid="1JEGfaZ4Ek6jM3r_YvFosQ" hash="6sdWVA">The concept that society has a strong interest in preserving marriages for the common good as well as the good of the couple and their children has been replaced for many by the idea that marriage is only a private relationship between consenting adults, terminable at the will of either.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/divorce.p5" pid="Nz07RBm3hkKQP7tkBEjQRw" hash="FtvnRg">Nations that had no divorce law have adopted one, and most nations permitting divorces have made them easier to obtain. Unfortunately, under current no-fault divorce laws, it can be easier to sever a marriage relationship with an unwanted spouse than an employment relationship with an unwanted employee. Some even refer to a first marriage as a “starter marriage,” like a small home one uses for a while before moving on.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/divorce.p6" pid="qJf8tjgXrUyf3oKR2G0UkA" hash="Rz1ukw">The weakening of the concept that marriages are permanent and precious has far-reaching consequences. Influenced by their own parents’ divorce or by popular notions that marriage is a ball and chain that prevents personal fulfillment, some young people shun marriage. Many who marry withhold full commitment, poised to flee at the first serious challenge.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/divorce.p7" pid="Fgyjc67D6U6JsPBJQHgflw" hash="_LjEgw">In contrast, modern prophets have warned that looking upon marriage “as a mere contract that may be entered into at pleasure … and severed at the first difficulty … is an evil meriting severe condemnation,” especially where children are made to suffer.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

Such unrighteous oppression of women was rejected by the Savior, who declared:</p>

        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/divorce.p11" pid="YsZsbaWvxkmmpLQbQcvqNw" hash="aO4FsA">The kind of marriage required for exaltation—eternal in duration and godlike in quality—does not contemplate divorce. In the temples of the Lord, couples are married for all eternity. But some marriages do not progress toward that ideal. Because “of the hardness of [our] hearts,” the Lord does not currently enforce the consequences of the celestial standard. He permits divorced persons to marry again without the stain of immorality specified in the higher law. Unless a divorced member has committed serious transgressions, he or she can become eligible for a temple recommend under the same worthiness standards that apply to other members.</p>

We know that many of you are innocent victims—members whose former spouses persistently betrayed sacred covenants or abandoned or refused to perform marriage responsibilities for an <span class="pageBreak" page-number="71"></span>extended period. Members who have experienced such abuse have firsthand knowledge of circumstances worse than divorce.</p>

I saw examples of this in the Philippines. Two days after their temple marriage, a husband deserted his young wife and has not been heard from for over 10 years. A married woman fled and obtained a divorce in another country, but her husband, who remained behind, is still married in the eyes of the Philippine law. Since there is no provision for divorce in that country, these innocent victims of desertion have no way to end their married status and go forward with their lives.</p>

Often the cause is not incompatibility but selfishness. The first step is not separation but reformation. Divorce is not an all-purpose solution, and it often creates long-term heartache. A broad-based international study of the levels of happiness before and after “major life events” found that, on average, persons are far more successful in recovering their level of happiness after the <span class="emphasis">death</span> of a spouse than after a <span class="emphasis">divorce.</span><span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> Spouses who hope that divorce will resolve conflicts often find that it aggravates them, since the complexities that follow divorce—especially where there are children—generate new conflicts.</p>

Because divorce separates the interests of children from the interests of their parents, children are its first victims. Scholars of family life tell us that the most important cause of the current decline in the well-being of children is the current weakening of marriage, because family instability decreases parental investment in children.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> We know that children raised in a single-parent home after divorce have a much higher risk for drug and alcohol abuse, sexual promiscuity, poor school performance, and various kinds of victimization.</p>

Under the law of the Lord, a marriage, like a human life, is a precious, living thing. If our bodies are sick, we seek to heal them. We do not give up. While there is any prospect <span class="pageBreak" page-number="72"></span>of life, we seek healing again and again. The same should be true of our marriages, and if we seek Him, the Lord will help us and heal us.</p>

        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/divorce.p30" pid="KX72OzI1WUOtUoRX7-7Jjw" hash="_0oX1A">In contrast, the couples who followed this bishop’s counsel and stayed together emerged with their marriages even stronger. That prospect began with their mutual commitment to keep the commandments, stay active in their Church attendance, scripture reading, and prayer, and to work on their own shortcomings. They “recognized <span class="pageBreak" page-number="73"></span>the importance and power of the Atonement for their spouse and for themselves,” and “they were patient and would try again and again.” When the couples he counseled did these things, repenting and working to save their marriages, this bishop reported that “healing was achieved 100 percent of the time.”</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/divorce.p31" pid="kByE9crTzEKsbIs9sVYL6Q" hash="JZ3-qQ">Even those who think their spouse is entirely to blame should not act hastily. One study found “no evidence that divorce or separation typically made adults happier than staying in an unhappy marriage. Two out of three unhappily married adults who avoided divorce reported being happily married five years later.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> A woman who persisted in an intolerable marriage for many years until the children were raised explained: “There were three parties to our marriage—my husband and I and the Lord. I told myself that if two of us could hang in there, we could hold it together.”</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/divorce.p32" pid="FYB3BlYJxEyxBNr7rIiaIA" hash="14fZBw">The power of hope expressed in these examples is sometimes rewarded with repentance and reformation, but sometimes it is not. Personal circumstances vary greatly. We cannot control and we are not responsible for the choices of others, even when they impact us so painfully. I am sure the Lord loves and blesses husbands and wives who lovingly try to help spouses struggling with such deep problems as pornography or other addictive behavior or with the long-term consequences of childhood abuse.</p>

When young Jacob “suffered afflictions and much sorrow” from the actions of other family members, Father Lehi assured him, “Thou knowest the greatness of God; and he shall consecrate thine afflictions for thy gain” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.1-2" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 2:1–2</a>). Similarly, the Apostle Paul assured us that “all things work together for good to them that love God” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/8.28" class="scriptureRef">Romans 8:28</a>).</p>

The best way to avoid <span class="emphasis">divorce</span> from an unfaithful, abusive, or unsupportive spouse is to avoid <span class="emphasis">marriage</span> to such a person. If you wish to marry well, inquire well. Associations through “hanging out” or exchanging information on the Internet are not a sufficient basis for marriage. There should be dating, followed by careful and thoughtful and thorough courtship. There should be ample opportunities to experience the prospective spouse’s behavior in a variety of circumstances. Fiancés should learn everything they can about the families with whom they will soon be joined in marriage. In all of this, we should realize that a good marriage does not require a perfect man or a perfect woman. It only requires a man and a woman committed to strive together toward perfection.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/divorce.p35" pid="DnyeG0q53E2mNCfZDKDhzg" hash="bhSayQ">President Spencer W. Kimball taught: “Two individuals approaching the marriage altar must realize that to attain the happy marriage which they hope for they must know that marriage … means sacrifice, sharing, and even a reduction of some personal liberties. It means long, hard economizing. It means children who bring with them financial burdens, service burdens, care and worry burdens; but also it means the deepest and sweetest emotions of all.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>

The number of good things we can do far exceeds the time available to accomplish them. Some things are better than good, and these are the things that should command priority attention in our lives.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/good-better-best.p" pid="QDx2QbTjVkuwjStW1QHy8A" hash="D8pCJQ">Jesus taught this principle in the home of Martha. While she was “cumbered about much serving” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/10.40" class="scriptureRef">Luke 10:40</a>), her sister, Mary, “sat at Jesus’ feet, and heard his word” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/10.39" class="scriptureRef">v. 39</a>). When Martha complained that her sister had left her to serve alone, Jesus commended Martha for what she was doing (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/10.41" class="scriptureRef">v. 41</a>) but taught her that “one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/10.42" class="scriptureRef">v. 42</a>). It was praiseworthy for Martha to be “careful and troubled about many things” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/10.41" class="scriptureRef">v. 41</a>), but learning the gospel from the Master Teacher was more “needful.” The scriptures contain other teachings that some things are more blessed than others (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/20.35" class="scriptureRef">Acts 20:35</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.14-15" class="scriptureRef">Alma 32:14–15</a>).</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/good-better-best.p" pid="VVVXzxDeRkK4IGl8xDtsgQ" hash="z3PLdQ">A childhood experience introduced me to the idea that some choices are good but others are better. I lived for two years on a farm. We rarely went to town. Our Christmas shopping was done in the Sears, Roebuck catalog. I spent hours poring over its pages. For the rural families of that day, catalog pages were like the shopping mall or the Internet of our time.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/good-better-best.p" pid="Ya0CXK8AR0CpTtGroyndaA" hash="gO8lNw">Something about some displays of merchandise in the catalog fixed itself in my mind. There were three degrees of quality: good, better, and best. For example, some men’s shoes were labeled <span class="emphasis">good</span> ($1.84), some <span class="emphasis">better</span> ($2.98), and some <span class="emphasis">best</span> ($3.45).<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

Other choices are better, and still others are <span class="pageBreak" page-number="105"></span>best. Even though a particular choice is more costly, its far greater value may make it the best choice of all.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/good-better-best.p" pid="tDHD0FoznkC9VMK3WEKumA" hash="mVKN-w">Consider how we use our time in the choices we make in viewing television, playing video games, surfing the Internet, or reading books or magazines. Of course it is good to view wholesome entertainment or to obtain interesting information. But not everything of that sort is worth the portion of our life we give to obtain it. Some things are better, and others are best. When the Lord told us to seek learning, He said, “Seek ye out of the <span class="emphasis">best</span> books words of wisdom” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.118" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:118</a>; emphasis added).</p>

Many breadwinners worry that their occupations leave too little time for their families. There is no easy formula for that contest of priorities. However, I have never known of a man who looked back on his working life and said, “I just didn’t spend enough time with my job.”</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/good-better-best.p" pid="85cGz1mT-UOFhUr-xIuT_w" hash="4Vn_tg">In choosing how we spend time as a family, we should be careful not to exhaust our available time on things that are merely good and leave little time for that which is better or best. A friend took his young family on a series of summer vacation trips, including visits to memorable historic sites. At the end of the summer he asked his teenage son which of these good summer activities he enjoyed most. The father learned from the reply, and so did those he told of it. “The thing I liked best this summer,” the boy replied, “was the night you and I laid on the lawn and looked at the stars and talked.” Super family activities may be good for children, but they are not always better than one-on-one time with a loving parent.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/good-better-best.p" pid="hje7R-CfV0m1w4Ks-UTx2g" hash="VC_8FA">The amount of children-and-parent time absorbed in the good activities of private lessons, team sports, and other school and club activities also needs to be carefully regulated. Otherwise, children will be overscheduled, and parents will be frazzled and frustrated. Parents should act to preserve time for family prayer, family scripture study, family home evening, and the other precious togetherness and individual one-on-one time that binds a family together and fixes children’s values on things of eternal worth. Parents should teach gospel priorities through what they do with their children.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/good-better-best.p" pid="uybRgW2sdE22t8sZ18sPow" hash="LqrP5g">Family experts have warned against what they call “the overscheduling of children.” In the last generation children are far busier and families spend far less time together. Among many measures of this disturbing trend are the reports that structured sports time has doubled, but children’s free time has declined by 12 hours per week, and unstructured outdoor activities have fallen by 50 percent.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/good-better-best.p" pid="3EuNAlHA406A3mtSGa1QNw" hash="oDB_oA">The number of those who report <span class="pageBreak" page-number="106"></span>that their “whole family usually eats dinner together” has declined 33 percent. This is most concerning because the time a family spends together “eating meals at home [is] the strongest predictor of children’s academic achievement and psychological adjustment.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> Family mealtimes have also been shown to be a strong bulwark against children’s smoking, drinking, or using drugs.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> There is inspired wisdom in this advice to parents: what your children really want for dinner is you.</p>

Hinckley has pleaded that we “work at our responsibility as parents as if everything in life counted on it, because in fact everything in life does count on it.”</p>

Priorities are needed there also.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/good-better-best.p" pid="bJfGvCUZlEuM9C8_DqVhrg" hash="Tw5iWw">Members of the Quorum of the Twelve have stressed the importance of exercising inspired judgment in Church programs and activities. Elder L. Tom Perry taught this principle in our first worldwide leadership training meeting in 2003. Counseling the same leaders in 2004, Elder Richard G. Scott said: “Adjust your activities to be consistent with your local conditions and resources. … Make sure that the essential needs are met, but do not go overboard in creating so many good things to do that the essential ones are not accomplished. … Remember, don’t magnify the work to be done—simplify it.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/good-better-best.p" pid="hThI08YqAUaDVGlhyIV_Yg" hash="RdM3iA">In general conference last year, Elder M. Russell Ballard warned against the deterioration of family relationships that can result when we spend excess time on ineffective activities that yield little spiritual sustenance. He cautioned against complicating our Church service “with needless frills and embellishments that occupy too much time, cost too much money, and sap too much energy. … The instruction to magnify our callings is not a command to embellish and complicate them. To innovate does not necessarily mean to expand; very often it means to simplify. … What is most important <span class="pageBreak" page-number="107"></span>in our Church responsibilities,” he said, “is not the statistics that are reported or the meetings that are held but whether or not individual people—ministered to one at a time just as the Savior did—have been lifted and encouraged and ultimately changed.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/good-better-best.p" pid="DNzmazQcuEGkdHqxebLdSg" hash="HORh6Q">Stake presidencies and bishoprics need to exercise their authority to weed out the excessive and ineffective busyness that is sometimes required of the members of their stakes or wards. Church programs should focus on what is best (most effective) in achieving their assigned purposes without unduly infringing on the time families need for their “divinely appointed duties.”</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/good-better-best.p" pid="DjMU9HfqY0iYNTlEk22wnw" hash="NhsPZw">But here is a caution for families. Suppose Church leaders reduce the time required by Church meetings and activities in order to increase the time available for families to be together. This will not achieve its intended purpose unless individual family members—especially parents—vigorously act to increase family togetherness and one-on-one time. Team sports and technology toys like video games and the Internet are already winning away the time of our children and youth. Surfing the Internet is not better than serving the Lord or strengthening the family. Some young men and women are skipping Church youth activities or cutting family time in order to participate in soccer leagues or to pursue various entertainments. Some young people are amusing themselves to death—spiritual death.</p>

Many years of inspired work have produced our 2008 volume of the teachings of Joseph Smith, the founding prophet of this dispensation. This is a landmark among Church books. In the past, some teachers have given a chapter of the <span class="emphasis">Teachings</span> manuals no more than a brief mention and then substituted a lesson of their own choice.

Knowledge of outside temperature can be verified by scientific proof. Knowledge that we love our spouse is personal and subjective. While not capable of scientific proof, it is still important. The idea that all important knowledge is based on scientific evidence is simply untrue.</p>

This is what Jesus taught in response to Simon Peter’s testimony that He was the Christ: “Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/16.17" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 16:17</a>).

In modern revelation God promises us that we will receive “knowledge” by His telling us in our mind and in our heart “by the Holy Ghost” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/8.1-2" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 8:1–2</a>).</p>

In the case of spiritual knowledge, the next step is to ask God in sincere prayer. As we read in modern revelation, “If thou shalt ask, thou shalt receive revelation upon revelation, knowledge upon knowledge, that thou mayest know the mysteries and peaceable things—that which bringeth joy, that which bringeth life eternal” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.61" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 42:61</a>).</p>

Jesus taught, “If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/7.17" class="scriptureRef">John 7:17</a>).</p>

Consequently, the things we must do to acquire, strengthen, and retain a testimony are vital to our spiritual life. In addition to those already stated, we need to partake of the sacrament each week (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.9" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:9</a>) to qualify for the precious promise that we will “always have his Spirit to be with [us]” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.77" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:77</a>). Of course, that Spirit is the source of our testimonies.</p>

Though some profess atheism, there are many who are open to additional truths about God. To these sincere seekers, we need to affirm the existence of God the Eternal Father, the divine mission of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and the reality of the Restoration. We must be valiant in our testimony of Jesus. Each of us has many opportunities to proclaim our spiritual convictions to friends and neighbors, to fellow workers, and to casual acquaintances. We should use these opportunities to express our love for our Savior, our witness of His divine mission, and our determination to serve Him.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> Our children should also hear us bear our testimonies <span class="pageBreak" page-number="28"></span>frequently.

When we encounter such misrepresentations, we have a duty to speak out to clarify our doctrine and what we believe. We should be the ones to state our beliefs rather than allowing others the final word in misrepresenting them. This calls for testimony, which can be expressed privately to an acquaintance or publicly in a small or large meeting. As we testify of the truth we know, we should faithfully follow the caution to speak “in mildness and in meekness” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38.41" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 38:41</a>). We should never be overbearing, shrill, or reviling. As the Apostle Paul taught, we should speak the truth in love (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/4.15" class="scriptureRef">Ephesians 4:15</a>).

Members who have a testimony and who act upon it under the direction of their Church leaders are sometimes accused of blind obedience.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/testimony.p28" pid="5E0ZvomHtEOzSVOPBQNidg" hash="-p1tUQ">Of course, we have leaders, and of course, we are subject to their decisions and directions in the operation of the Church and in the performance of needed priesthood ordinances. But when it comes to learning and knowing the truth of the gospel—our personal testimonies—we each have a direct relationship with God, our Eternal Father, and His Son, Jesus Christ, through the powerful witness of the Holy Ghost. This is what our critics fail to understand. It puzzles them that we can be united in following our leaders and yet independent in knowing for ourselves.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/testimony.p29" pid="gXwUeksYFku3i_uMRNNhrg" hash="4tpwVg">Perhaps the puzzle some feel can be explained by the reality that each of us has two different channels to God. We have a channel of governance through our prophet and other leaders. This channel, which has to do with doctrine, ordinances, and commandments, results in obedience. We also have a channel of personal testimony, which is direct to God. This has to do with His existence, our relationship to Him, and the truth of His restored gospel. This channel results in knowledge. These two channels are mutually reinforcing: knowledge encourages obedience (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/deut/5.27" class="scriptureRef">Deuteronomy 5:27</a>; <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.11" class="scriptureRef">Moses 5:11</a>), and obedience enhances knowledge (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/7.17" class="scriptureRef">John 7:17</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.1" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 93:1</a>).</p>

Whether in science or religion, our obedience is not blind when we act upon knowledge suited <span class="pageBreak" page-number="29"></span>to the subject of our action. A scientist receives and acts upon a trusted certification of the content or conditions of a particular experiment. In matters of religion, a believer’s source of knowledge is spiritual, but the principle is the same. In the case of Latter-day Saints, when the Holy Ghost gives our souls a witness of the truth of the restored gospel and the calling of a modern prophet, our choice to follow those teachings is not blind obedience.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/testimony.p31" pid="XoP6X6oDokqsMLhsGo2ZsA" hash="mGtn3A">In all of our testifying we must avoid arrogance and pride. We should remember the Book of Mormon rebuke to a people who had such pride in the greater things God had given them that they afflicted their neighbors (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2.20" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 2:20</a>). Jacob said this was “abominable unto him who created all flesh” because “the one being is as precious in his sight as the other” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2.21" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 2:21</a>). Later, Alma cautioned that “ye shall not esteem one flesh above another, or one man shall not think himself above another” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/23.7" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 23:7</a>).</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/testimony.p32" pid="Q5EJm7fPVEehrhQmenbgHQ" hash="Naj3nw">I close with my testimony. I know that we have a Heavenly Father, whose plan brings us to earth and provides the conditions and destiny of our eternal journey. I know that we have a Savior, Jesus Christ, whose teachings define the plan and whose Atonement gives the assurance of immortality and the opportunity for eternal life. I know that the Father and the Son appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith to restore the fulness of the gospel in these latter days. And I know that we are led today by a prophet, President Thomas S. Monson, who holds the keys to authorize priesthood holders to perform the ordinances prescribed for our progress toward eternal life. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

That Spirit is the foundation of our testimony. It testifies of the Father and the Son, brings all things to our remembrance, and leads us into truth. It is the compass to guide us on our path.

Typically the sacrament is administered, passed, and received by the members in an atmosphere of quiet reverence. The conducting of the meeting, including the necessary business, is brief and dignified, and the talks are spiritual in content and delivery. The music is appropriate, and so are the prayers. This is the standard, and it represents great progress since the experiences of my youth.</p>

In a worldwide leadership training meeting five years ago, Elder Russell M. Nelson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught the priesthood leaders of the Church how to plan and conduct sacrament meetings. “We commemorate His Atonement in a very personal way,” Elder Nelson said. “We bring a broken heart and a contrite spirit to our sacrament meeting. It is the highlight of our Sabbath-day observance” (“Worshiping at Sacrament Meeting,” <span class="emphasis">Liahona,</span> Aug. 2004, 12; <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Aug. 2004, 26).</p>

Instead, “ye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a contrite spirit” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.20" class="scriptureRef">3 Nephi 9:20</a>). That commandment, repeated in the modern revelation directing us to partake of the sacrament each week, tells us how we should prepare. As Elder Nelson taught, “Each member of the Church bears responsibility for the spiritual enrichment that can come from a sacrament meeting” (<span class="emphasis">Liahona,</span> Aug. 2004, 14; <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Aug. 2004, 28).</p>

This ordinance was introduced so that we can renew our covenants to serve Him, to obey Him, and to always remember Him. President Smith adds: “We cannot retain the Spirit of the Lord if we do not consistently comply with this commandment” (<span class="emphasis">Doctrines of Salvation,</span> comp. Bruce R.

If we are going swimming or hiking or playing on the beach, our clothing, including our footwear, will indicate this. The same should be true of how we dress when we are to participate in the ordinance of the sacrament. It is like going to the temple. Our manner of dress indicates the degree to which we understand and honor the ordinance in which we will participate.</p>

Even a person who slips into quiet slumber does not interfere with others. Sacrament meeting is not a time for reading books or magazines. Young people, it is not a time for whispered conversations on cell phones or for texting persons at other locations.

How sad to see persons obviously violating that covenant in the very meeting where they are making it.</p>

The First Presidency has declared that “some of the greatest sermons are preached by the singing of hymns” (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> ix). How wonderful when every person in attendance joins in the worship of singing—especially in the hymn that helps us prepare to partake of the sacrament.

I love President Thomas S. Monson’s account of how, as a 12-year-old deacon, he was asked by the bishop to take the sacrament to a bedfast brother who longed for this blessing. “His gratitude overwhelmed me,” President Monson said. “The Spirit of the Lord came over me.

The scriptural warning about partaking of the sacrament unworthily (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/11.29" class="scriptureRef">1 Corinthians 11:29</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18.29" class="scriptureRef">3 Nephi 18:29</a>) surely applies also to those who officiate in that ordinance.

Holland gave a valuable teaching on this subject in general conference 13 years ago. Since most of our current deacons were not even born when these words were last spoken here, I repeat them for their benefit and that of their parents and teachers: “May I suggest that wherever possible a white shirt be worn by the deacons, teachers, and priests who handle the sacrament. For sacred ordinances in the Church we often use ceremonial clothing, and a white shirt could be seen as a gentle reminder of the white clothing you wore in the baptismal font and an anticipation of the white shirt you will soon wear into the temple and onto your missions” (“This Do in Remembrance of Me,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1995, 68).</p>

This is why the sacrament is not generally served in the home or at family reunions, even where there are sufficient priesthood holders available. Those who officiate at the sacrament table, prepare the sacrament, or pass it to the congregation should be designated by one who holds or exercises the keys of this ordinance. I refer to the bishopric or to the presidencies of the teachers or deacons quorums. “[My] house is a house of order,” the Lord declared (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.8" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 132:8</a>).</p>

We need to qualify for the cleansing power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. We do this by keeping His commandment to come to Him with a broken heart and a contrite spirit and in that wonderful weekly meeting partake of the emblems of the sacrament and make the covenants that qualify us for the precious promise that we will always have His Spirit to be with us (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.77" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:77</a>).

Seniors put aside the diversions of retirement, the comforts of home, and the loving companionship of children and grandchildren and go forth to serve strangers in unfamiliar places. Young men and women put work and education on hold and make themselves available to serve wherever they are assigned. Hundreds of thousands of faithful members participate in the unselfish service we call “temple work,” which has no motive other than love and service for our fellowmen, living and dead.

Perhaps when we [face] our Maker, we will not be asked, ‘How many positions did you hold?’ but rather, ‘How many people did you help?’ In reality,” President Monson concluded, “you can never love the Lord until you serve Him by serving His people.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

Mothers suffer pain and loss of personal priorities and comforts to bear and rear each child. Fathers adjust their lives and priorities to support a family. The gap between those who are and those who are not willing to do this is widening in today’s world. One of our family members recently overheard a young couple on an airline flight explaining that they chose to have a dog instead of children. “Dogs are less trouble,” they declared. “Dogs don’t talk back, and we never have to ground them.”</p>

We also rejoice in those who care for disabled family members and aged parents. None of this service asks, what’s in it for me? All of it requires setting aside personal convenience for unselfish service. All of it stands in contrast to the fame, fortune, and other immediate gratification that are the worldly ways of so many in our day.</p>

The Mormon pioneers who colonized the Intermountain West established our honored tradition of unselfish cooperation for the common good. Following in this tradition are our modern “Helping Hands” projects in many nations.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> In recent elections Latter-day Saints have united with other like-minded persons in efforts to defend marriage. For some, that service has involved great sacrifice and continuing personal pain.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/unselfish-service.p12" pid="pOZVMI2n0ES1K0jWWaqTpA" hash="e5HvBQ">Our members’ religious faith and Church service have taught them how to work in cooperative efforts to benefit the larger community. Because of this, Latter-day Saint volunteers are in great demand in education, local government, charitable causes, and countless other efforts that call for high skills in cooperative efforts and unselfish sacrifice of time and means.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/unselfish-service.p13" pid="y9ChSXwaFUuAetPq1MP96A" hash="GJCx1g">Some attribute our members’ willingness to sacrifice and their skills in cooperative efforts to our effective Church organization or to what skeptics mistakenly call “blind obedience.” Neither explanation is correct. No outside copying of our organization and no application of blind obedience could duplicate the record of this Church or the performance of its members. Our willingness to sacrifice and our skills in cooperative efforts come from our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, from the inspired teachings of our leaders, and from the commitments and covenants we knowingly make.</p>

Jesus cautioned that Satan desires to sift us like wheat (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/22.31" class="scriptureRef">Luke 22:31</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18.18" class="scriptureRef">3 Nephi 18:18</a>), which means to make us common like all those around us. But Jesus taught that we who follow Him should be precious and unique, “the salt of the earth” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.13" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 5:13</a>) and “the light of the world,” to shine forth to all men (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.14,16" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 5:14, 16</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18.24" class="scriptureRef">3 Nephi 18:24</a>).</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/unselfish-service.p15" pid="uZgPrXXdTU-3N9YoD4UtqA" hash="vvApxQ">We do not serve our Savior well if we fear man more than God. He rebuked some leaders in His restored Church for seeking the praise of the world and for having their minds on the things of the earth more than on the things of the Lord (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/30.2" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 30:2</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.39" class="scriptureRef">58:39</a>). Those chastisements remind us that we are called to establish the Lord’s standards, not to follow the <span class="pageBreak" page-number="95"></span>world’s. Elder John A. Widtsoe declared, “We cannot walk as other men, or talk as other men, or do as other men, for we have a different destiny, obligation, and responsibility placed upon us, and we must fit ourselves [to it].”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> That reality has current application to every trendy action, including immodest dress. As a wise friend observed, “You can’t be a life saver if you look like all the other swimmers on the beach.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/unselfish-service.p16" pid="pH6PkiUCXUeSdnkH8y-LDg" hash="4wJkJA">Those who are caught up in trying to save their lives by seeking the praise of the world are actually rejecting the Savior’s teaching that the only way to save our eternal life is to love one another and lose our lives in service.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/unselfish-service.p17" pid="dz1ovm2XQUOhoAl1vWs8_Q" hash="h5rp_w">C. S. Lewis explained this teaching of the Savior: “The moment you have a self at all, there is a possibility of putting yourself first—wanting to be the centre—wanting to be God, in fact. That was the sin of Satan: and that was the sin he taught the human race. Some people think the fall of man had something to do with sex, but that is a mistake. … <span class="emphasis">What Satan put into the heads of our remote ancestors was the idea that they could ‘be like gods’—could set up on their own as if they had created themselves—be their own masters—invent some sort of happiness for themselves outside God, apart from God.</span> And out of that hopeless attempt has come … the long terrible story of man trying to find something other than God which will make him happy.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/unselfish-service.p18" pid="1xBOWwR0SEWlzlNJ4zwKRA" hash="JrKRNw">A selfish person is more interested in pleasing man—especially himself—than in pleasing God. He looks only to his own needs and desires. He walks “in his own way, and after the image of his own god, whose image is in the likeness of the world” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.16" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:16</a>). Such a person becomes disconnected from the covenant promises of God (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.15" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:15</a>) and from the mortal friendship and assistance we all need in these tumultuous times. In contrast, if we love and serve one another as the Savior taught, we remain connected to our covenants and to our associates.</p>

Someone has called this the “me” generation—a selfish time when everyone seems to be asking, what’s in it for me? Even some who should know better seem to be straining to win the praise of those who mock and scoff from the “great and spacious building” identified in vision as the pride of the world (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.26-28" class="scriptureRef">1 Nephi 8:26–28</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11.35-36" class="scriptureRef">11:35–36</a>).</p>

The ancient evil of greed shows its face in the assertion of entitlement: I am entitled to this or that because of who I am—a son or a daughter, a citizen, a victim, or a member of some other group. Entitlement is generally selfish. It demands much, and it gives little or nothing. Its very concept causes us to seek to elevate ourselves above those around us. This separates us from the divine, evenhanded standard of reward that when anyone obtains any blessing from God, it is by obedience to the law on which that blessing is predicated (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.21" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 130:21</a>).</p>

The gambler ventures a minimum amount in the hope of a huge return that comes by taking it away from others. No matter how it is disguised, getting something for nothing is contrary to the gospel law of the harvest: “Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/gal/6.7" class="scriptureRef">Galatians 6:7</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/nt/2-cor/9.6" class="scriptureRef">2 Corinthians 9:6</a>).</p>

It is contrary to eternal progress toward the destiny God has identified in His great plan for His children. The plan of the gospel of Jesus Christ lifts us above our selfish desires and teaches us that this life is all about what we can become.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/unselfish-service.p24" pid="FOragpxJvUCZzxeofCZSKA" hash="8K1DXA">A great example of unselfish service is the late Mother Teresa of Calcutta, whose vow committed herself and her fellow workers to “wholehearted free service to the poorest of the poor.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> She taught that “one thing will always secure heaven for us—the acts of charity and kindness with which we have filled our lives.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> “We can do no great things,” Mother Teresa maintained, “only small things with great <span class="pageBreak" page-number="96"></span>love.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> When this wonderful Catholic servant died, the First Presidency’s message of condolence declared, “Her life of unselfish service is an inspiration to all the world, and her acts of Christian goodness will stand as a memorial for generations to come.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> That is what the Savior called losing our lives in service to others.</p>

Some say “I didn’t learn anything today” or “No one was friendly to me” or “I was offended” or “The Church is not filling my needs.” All those answers are self-centered, and all retard spiritual growth.</p>

        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/love-and-law.p6" pid="7WscytpkFkGaAW1MQMuQWg" hash="aIA3ww">First, consider the love of God, described so meaningfully this morning by President Dieter F. Uchtdorf. “Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?” the Apostle Paul asked. Not tribulation, not persecution, not peril or the sword (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/8.35" class="scriptureRef">Romans 8:35</a>). “For I am persuaded,” he concluded, “that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, … nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/8.38-39" class="scriptureRef">verses 38–39</a>).</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/love-and-law.p7" pid="R9zERBtbXESb47wQZ8F6qA" hash="9PEPhg">There is no greater evidence of the infinite power and perfection of God’s love than is declared by the Apostle John: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/3.16" class="scriptureRef">John 3:16</a>). Another Apostle wrote that God “spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/8.32" class="scriptureRef">Romans 8:32</a>). Think how it must have grieved our Heavenly Father to send His Son to endure incomprehensible suffering for our sins. That is the greatest evidence of His love for each of us!</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/love-and-law.p8" pid="4VXepFUcEEqEHX8cDoHJCw" hash="Jl3HNA">God’s love for His children is an eternal reality, but why does He love us so much, and why do we desire that love? The answer is found in the relationship between God’s love and His laws.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/love-and-law.p9" pid="_NMhisYhRUu6B5qVwieGRw" hash="ohH9mA">Some seem to value God’s love because of their hope that His love is so great and so unconditional that it will mercifully excuse them from obeying His laws. In contrast, those who understand God’s plan for His children know that God’s laws are invariable, which is another great evidence of His love for His children. <span class="pageBreak" page-number="27"></span>Mercy cannot rob justice,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> and those who obtain mercy are “they who have kept the covenant and observed the commandment” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/54.6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 54:6</a>).</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/love-and-law.p10" pid="KteGmxQWak--vSQp8IerRA" hash="DnOxqQ">We read again and again in the Bible and in modern scriptures of God’s anger with the wicked<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> and of His acting in His wrath<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> against those who violate His laws. How are anger and wrath evidence of His love? Joseph Smith taught that God “institute[d] laws whereby [the spirits that He would send into the world] could have a privilege to advance like himself.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> God’s love is so perfect that He lovingly requires us to obey His commandments because He knows that only through obedience to His laws can we become perfect, as He is. For this reason, God’s anger and His wrath are not a <span class="emphasis">contradiction </span>of His love but an <span class="emphasis">evidence </span>of His love. Every parent knows that you can love a child totally and completely while still being creatively angry and disappointed at that child’s self-defeating behavior.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/love-and-law.p11" pid="UlBp1tpODkuEEO1jE0Lxsg" hash="UE4Z5w">The love of God is so universal that His perfect plan bestows many gifts on all of His children, even those who disobey His laws. Mortality is one such gift, bestowed on all who qualified in the War in Heaven.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> Another unconditional gift is the universal resurrection: “For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15.22" class="scriptureRef">1 Corinthians 15:22</a>). Many other mortal gifts are not tied to our personal obedience to law. As Jesus taught, our Heavenly Father “maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.45" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 5:45</a>).</p>

A woman recently returned to Church activity gave this description in a sacrament meeting talk: “He has always been there for me, even when I rejected Him.

One such opportunity has to do with the gifts parents bestow on their children. Just as God has bestowed some gifts on all of His mortal children without requiring their personal obedience to His laws, parents provide many benefits like housing and food even if their children are not in total harmony with all parental requirements. But, following the example of an all-wise and loving Heavenly Father who has given laws and commandments for the benefit of His children, wise parents condition some parental gifts on obedience.</p>

We use nutrition, exercise, and other practices to preserve health, and we enlist the help of healing practitioners, such as physicians and surgeons, to restore health.</p>

When a person requested a priesthood blessing, Brigham Young would ask, “Have you used any remedies?” To those who said no because “we wish the Elders to lay hands upon us, and we have faith that we shall be healed,” President Young replied: “That is very inconsistent according to my faith. If we are sick, and ask the Lord to heal us, and to do all for us that is necessary to be done, according to my understanding of the Gospel of salvation, I might as well ask the Lord to cause my wheat and corn to grow, without my plowing the ground and casting in the seed. It appears consistent to me to apply every remedy that comes within the range of my knowledge, and [then] to ask my Father in Heaven … to sanctify that application to the healing of my body.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

This follows the scriptural teachings that we should “pray always” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/90.24" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 90:24</a>) and that all things should be done in wisdom and order.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

Many scriptures refer to the power of faith in the healing of an individual. The Apostle James taught that we should “pray one for another, that ye may be healed,” adding, “the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/5.16" class="scriptureRef">James 5:16</a>). When the woman who touched Jesus was healed, He told her, “Thy faith hath made thee whole” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/9.22" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 9:22</a>).<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> Similarly, the Book of Mormon teaches that the Lord “worketh by power, according to the faith of the children of men” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.7" class="scriptureRef">Moroni 10:7</a>).</p>

We also hear examples of this among people of faith in other churches. A Texas newspaperman described such a miracle. When a five-year-old girl breathed with difficulty and became feverish, her parents rushed her to the hospital. By the time she arrived there, her kidneys and lungs had shut down, her fever was 107 degrees, and her body was bright red and covered with purple lesions. The doctors said she was dying of toxic shock syndrome, cause unknown. As word spread to family and friends, God-fearing people began praying for her, and a special prayer service was held in their Protestant congregation in Waco, Texas. Miraculously, she suddenly returned from the brink of death and was released from the hospital in a little over a week. Her grandfather wrote, “She is living proof that God does answer prayers and work miracles.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>

The ill one and the family often seem to depend wholly on the power of the priesthood and the gift of healing that they hope the administering brethren may have, whereas the greater responsibility is with him who is blessed. … The major element is the faith of the individual when that person is conscious and accountable. ‘Thy faith hath made thee whole’ [<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/9.22" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 9:22</a>] was repeated so often by the Master that it almost became a chorus.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span></p>
          <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/healing-the-sick.p19" pid="JZsDef8fREuPYtiJ0HtXDQ" hash="Kf5DOg">President Kimball even suggested that “too frequent administrations may be an indication of lack of faith or of the ill one trying to pass the responsibility for faith development to the elders rather than self.” He told about a faithful sister who received a priesthood blessing. When asked the next day if she wished to be administered to again, she replied: “No, I have been anointed and administered to. The ordinance has been performed. It is up to me now to claim my blessing through my faith.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span></p>

          <h4 class="title" pid="8HUZpnY3skOScGBRaR5bdA" hash="SRLZ4w">Words of Blessing</h4>
          <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/healing-the-sick.p20" pid="ayhx08jWGEyDd_nATf4BLg" hash="KRwqyg">Another part of a priesthood blessing is the words of blessing spoken by the elder after he seals the anointing. These words can be very important, but their content is not essential and they are not recorded on the records of the Church. In some priesthood blessings—like a patriarchal blessing—the words spoken are the essence of the blessing. But in a healing blessing it is the other parts of the blessing—the anointing, the sealing, faith, and the will of the Lord—that are the essential elements.</p>
          <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/healing-the-sick.p21" pid="NYlpKUPav0iSWr7bedMZ6Q" hash="VdbpRw">Ideally, the elder who officiates will be so in tune with the Spirit of the Lord that he will know and declare the will of the Lord in the words of the blessing. Brigham Young taught priesthood holders, “It is your privilege and duty to live so that you know when the word of the Lord is spoken to you and when the mind of the Lord is revealed to you.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> When that happens, the spoken blessing is fulfilled literally and miraculously. On some choice occasions I have experienced that certainty of inspiration in a healing blessing and have known that what I was saying was the will of the Lord. However, like most who officiate in healing blessings, I have often struggled with uncertainty on the words I should say. For a variety of causes, every elder experiences increases and decreases in his level of sensitivity to the promptings of the Spirit. Every elder who gives a blessing is subject to influence by what he desires for the person afflicted. Each of these and other mortal imperfections can influence the words we speak.</p>
          <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/healing-the-sick.p22" pid="CheFgiwN_kuDbJrbFsddlQ" hash="MrBWmQ">Fortunately, the words spoken in a healing blessing are not essential to its healing effect. If faith is sufficient and if the Lord wills it, the afflicted person will be healed or blessed whether the officiator speaks those words or not. Conversely, if the officiator yields to personal desire or inexperience and gives commands or words of blessing in excess of what the Lord chooses to bestow according to the faith of the individual, those words will not be fulfilled. Consequently, brethren, no <span class="pageBreak" page-number="50"></span>elder should ever hesitate to participate in a healing blessing because of fear that he will not know what to say. The words spoken in a healing blessing can edify and energize the faith of those who hear them, but the effect of the blessing is dependent upon faith and the Lord’s will, not upon the words spoken by the elder who officiated.</p>

As we exercise the undoubted power of the priesthood of God and as we treasure His promise that He will hear and answer the prayer of faith, we must always remember that faith and the healing power of the priesthood cannot produce a result contrary to the will of Him whose priesthood it is. This principle is taught in the revelation directing that the elders of the Church shall lay their hands upon the sick. The Lord’s promise is that “he that hath faith in me to be healed, <span class="emphasis">and is not appointed unto death, shall be healed</span>” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.48" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 42:48</a>; emphasis added). Similarly, in another modern revelation the Lord declares that when one “asketh according to the will of God … it is done even as he asketh” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/46.30" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 46:30</a>).<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span></p>

          <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/healing-the-sick.p25" pid="0hVG_ZscwEebyJ2l5IKeOw" hash="jzWSEA">As children of God, knowing of His great love and His ultimate knowledge of what is best for our eternal welfare, we trust in Him. The first principle of the gospel is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, and faith means trust. I felt that trust in a talk my cousin gave at the funeral of a teenage girl who had died of a serious illness. He spoke these words, which first astonished me and then edified me: “I know it was the will of the Lord that she die. She had good medical care. She was given priesthood blessings. Her name was on the prayer roll in the temple. She was the subject of hundreds of prayers for her restoration to health. And I know that there is enough faith in this family that she would have been healed unless it was the will of the Lord to take her home at this time.” I felt that same trust in the words of the father of another choice girl whose life was taken by cancer in her teen years. He declared, “Our family’s faith is in Jesus Christ and is not dependent on outcomes.” Those teachings ring true to me. We do all that we can for the healing of a loved one, and then we trust in the Lord for the outcome.</p>

We pray to our Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ, and He answers us through His Holy Spirit and in other ways. The mission of the Holy Ghost is to testify of the Father and the Son (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/15.26" class="scriptureRef">John 15:26</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.18" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 31:18</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/28.11" class="scriptureRef">3 Nephi 28:11</a>), to guide us into truth (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.26" class="scriptureRef">John 14:26</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/16.13" class="scriptureRef">16:13</a>), and to show us all things we should do (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/32.5" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 32:5</a>). This personal line of communication with our Heavenly Father through His Holy Spirit is the source of our testimony of truth, of our knowledge, and of our personal guidance from a loving Heavenly Father. It is an essential feature of His marvelous gospel plan, which allows each one of His children to receive a personal witness of its truth.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/10/two-lines-of-communication.p3" pid="dhD5lzQD4UyoZFAECdnjEw" hash="K086aw">The direct, personal channel of communication to our Heavenly Father through the Holy Ghost is based on worthiness and is so essential that we are commanded to renew our covenants by partaking of the sacrament each Sabbath day. In this way we qualify for the promise that we may always have His Spirit to be with us, to guide us.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/10/two-lines-of-communication.p4" pid="pKqVWdmTtUCmVhwdB7dN-w" hash="2wI6yQ">On this personal line of communication with the Lord, our belief and practice is similar to that of those Christians who insist that human mediators between God and man are unnecessary because all have direct access to God under the principle Martin Luther espoused that is now known as “the priesthood of all believers.” I will say more of that later.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/10/two-lines-of-communication.p5" pid="f7H7UHDW5kGnFouA0Ue1hA" hash="JAM88w">The personal line is of paramount importance in personal decisions and in the governance of the family. Unfortunately, some members of our church underestimate the need for this direct, personal line. Responding to the undoubted importance of prophetic leadership—the priesthood line, which operates principally to govern heavenly communications on Church matters—some seek to have their priesthood leaders make personal decisions for them, decisions they should make for themselves by inspiration through their personal line. Personal decisions and family governance are principally a matter for the personal line.</p>

        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/10/two-lines-of-communication.p7" pid="tel5I6CEg0SaTrZrYpXB_g" hash="6uWwFQ">First, in its fulness the personal line does not function independent of the priesthood line. The gift of the Holy Ghost—the means of communication from God to man—is conferred by priesthood authority as authorized by those holding priesthood keys. It does not come merely by desire or belief. And the right to the continuous companionship of this Spirit needs to be affirmed each Sabbath as we worthily partake of the sacrament and renew our baptismal covenants of obedience and service.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/10/two-lines-of-communication.p8" pid="h_EmleZeWEyCEG1vpwj3Ig" hash="zYeThQ">Similarly, we cannot communicate reliably through the direct, personal line if we are disobedient to or out of harmony with the priesthood line. The Lord has declared that “the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.36" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:36</a>). Unfortunately, it is common for persons who are violating God’s commandments or disobedient to the counsel of their priesthood leaders to declare that God has revealed to them that they are excused from obeying some commandment or from following some counsel. Such persons may be receiving revelation or inspiration, but it is not from the source they suppose. The devil is the father of lies, and he is ever anxious to frustrate the work of God by his clever imitations.</p>

That is why we have commandments and ordinances. That is why we make covenants. That is how we qualify for the promised blessings. They all come through the mercy and grace of the Holy One of Israel, “after all we can do” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.23" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 25:23</a>).</p>

In this last dispensation, His priesthood authority was restored and His Church was reestablished through heavenly ministrations to the Prophet Joseph Smith. This restored priesthood and this reestablished Church are at the heart of the priesthood line.</p>

And it is this line through which He currently speaks through the teachings and counsel of living prophets and apostles and other inspired leaders. This is the way we receive the required ordinances. This is the way we receive calls to service in His Church. His Church is the way and His priesthood is the power through which we are privileged to participate in those cooperative activities that are essential to accomplishing the Lord’s work. These include preaching the gospel, building temples and chapels, and helping the poor.</p>

We believe the same but of course differ with other Christians on how we trace that authority.</p>

They underestimate the importance of the Church and its leaders and its programs. Relying entirely on the personal line, they go their own way, purporting to define doctrine and to direct competing organizations contrary to the teachings of prophet-leaders. In this they mirror the modern hostility to what is disparagingly called “organized religion.” Those who reject the need for organized religion reject the work of the Master, who established His Church and its officers in the meridian of time and who reestablished them in modern times.</p>

We all need a personal testimony of truth. As our faith develops, we necessarily rely on the words and faith of others, like our parents, teachers, or priesthood leaders (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/46.14" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 46:14</a>). But if we are solely dependent on one particular priesthood leader or teacher for our personal testimony of the truth instead of getting that testimony through the personal line, we will be forever vulnerable to disillusionment by the action of that person. When it comes to a mature knowledge or testimony of the truth, we should not be dependent on a mortal mediator between us and our Heavenly Father.</p>

Many scriptures teach that if we persist in serious violations of the commandments of God, we are “cut off from his presence” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/38.1" class="scriptureRef">Alma 38:1</a>).

He could not translate a single syllable. He went down stairs, out into the orchard and made supplication to the Lord; was gone about an hour—came back to the house, asked Emma’s forgiveness and then came up stairs where we were and the translation went on all right. He could do nothing save he was humble and faithful.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/10/two-lines-of-communication.p24" pid="gBldUhttCkuzIx7SFYs5rw" hash="6AH8hw">I will conclude with further examples of the need for both of the lines our Heavenly Father has established for communication with His children. Both lines are essential to His purpose to bring about the immortality and eternal life of His children. An early scriptural account of this need is in Father Jethro’s counsel that Moses should not try to do so much. The people were waiting upon their priesthood leader from morning till night to “enquire of God” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/18.15" class="scriptureRef">Exodus 18:15</a>) and also to “judge between one and another” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/18.16" class="scriptureRef">verse 16</a>). We often note how Jethro counseled Moses to delegate by appointing judges to handle the personal conflicts (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/18.21-22" class="scriptureRef">verses 21–22</a>). But Jethro also gave Moses counsel that illustrates the importance of the personal line: “Thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that <span class="emphasis">they</span> must do” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/18.20" class="scriptureRef">verse 20</a>; emphasis added).</p>

They should understand the commandments and seek inspiration to work out most problems for themselves.</p>

Chile suffered a devastating earthquake. Many of our members lost homes; some lost family members. Many lost confidence. Quickly—because our church is prepared to respond to such disasters—food, shelter, and other material aid was provided. The Saints of Chile heard the voice of the Lord through His Church and its leaders responding to their material needs. But however sufficient the priesthood line, it was not enough. Each member needed to seek the Lord in prayer and receive the direct message of comfort and guidance that comes through the Holy Spirit to those who seek and listen.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/10/two-lines-of-communication.p27" pid="ub-T3OSpa0S3QDgZgKyy4A" hash="UkoUBQ">Our missionary work is another example of the need for both lines. The men and women who are called to be missionaries are worthy and willing because of the teachings they have received through the priesthood line and the testimony they have received through the personal line. They are called through the priesthood line. Then, as representatives of the Lord and under the direction of His priesthood line, they teach investigators. Sincere seekers after truth listen, and the missionaries encourage them to pray to know the truth of the message for themselves through the personal line.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/10/two-lines-of-communication.p28" pid="XTHuxM-8tUyJFkBRPzgARA" hash="NPNW2g">A final example applies these principles to the subject of priesthood authority in the family and the Church.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> All priesthood authority in the Church functions under the direction of one who holds the appropriate priesthood keys. This is the priesthood line. But the authority that presides in the family—whether father or single-parent mother—functions in family matters without the need to get authorization from anyone holding priesthood keys. That is like the personal line. Both lines must be functioning in our family life and in our personal lives if we are to have the growth and achieve the destiny identified in our Heavenly Father’s plan for His children.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/10/two-lines-of-communication.p29" pid="_HGDp9UDUUKb0HFyipQUcw" hash="xUVYRw">We must use both the personal line and the priesthood line in proper balance to achieve the growth that is the purpose of mortal life. If personal religious practice relies too much on the personal line, individualism erases the importance of divine authority. If personal religious practice relies too much on the priesthood line, individual growth suffers. The children of God need both lines to achieve their eternal destiny. The restored gospel teaches both, and the restored Church provides both.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/10/two-lines-of-communication.p30" pid="4UioSe-PUUmOwkh8Vl5Qmg" hash="JqZ3RA">I testify of the Lord’s prophet, President Thomas S. Monson, who holds the keys that govern the priesthood line. I testify of the Lord Jesus Christ, whose church this is. And I testify of the restored gospel, whose truth can be known by each of us through the precious personal line to our Heavenly Father. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/desire.p1" pid="kUBQ-P8l_kC5hmcHVSkTIw" hash="YMsfbg">I have chosen to talk about the importance of <span class="emphasis">desire.</span> I hope each of us will search our hearts to determine what we really desire and how we rank our most important desires.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/desire.p2" pid="9cUD2nVvSEWwqQB0rnhKWg" hash="HFe9Hg">Desires dictate our priorities, priorities shape our choices, and choices determine our actions. The desires we act on determine our changing, our achieving, and our becoming.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/desire.p3" pid="JFRA6ZhVF0Op73GOI5r9LA" hash="54u8tg">First I speak of some common desires. As mortal beings we have some basic physical needs. Desires to satisfy these needs compel our choices and determine our actions. Three examples will demonstrate how we sometimes override these desires with other desires that we consider more important.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/desire.p4" pid="EaEE6BIyQ0uYBATQ1S226Q" hash="LOfsNA">First, food. We have a basic need for food, but for a time that desire can be overridden by a stronger desire to fast.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/desire.p5" pid="mDMt-OrezE-PYNlN0M42ZQ" hash="irNmpQ">Second, shelter. As a 12-year-old boy I resisted a desire for shelter because of my greater desire to fulfill a Boy Scout requirement to spend a night in the woods. I was one of several boys who left comfortable tents and found a way to construct a shelter and make a primitive bed from the natural materials we could find.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/desire.p6" pid="AzGgqY4JuEG3GR62_8c7_Q" hash="8z9SnA">Third, sleep. Even this basic desire can be temporarily overridden by an even more important desire. As a young soldier in the Utah National Guard, I learned an example of this from a combat-seasoned officer.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/desire.p7" pid="6n42bld2fkuQBsM2CFwvHQ" hash="VGm2XA">In the early months of the Korean War, a Richfield Utah National Guard field artillery battery was called into active service. This battery, commanded by Captain Ray Cox, consisted of about 40 Mormon men. After additional training and reinforcement by reservists from elsewhere, they were sent to Korea, where they experienced some of the fiercest combat of that war. In one battle they had to repel a direct assault by hundreds of enemy infantry, the kind of attack that overran and destroyed other field artillery batteries.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/desire.p8" pid="jkoykIsQo0WXaKv9Zb1wkQ" hash="AwxcCA">What does this have to do with overcoming the desire for sleep? During one critical night, when enemy infantry had poured through the front lines and into the rear areas occupied by the artillery, the captain had the field telephone lines wired into his tent and ordered his numerous perimeter guards to phone him personally each hour on the hour all night long. This kept the guards awake, but it also meant that Captain Cox had scores of interruptions to his sleep. “How could you do that?” I asked him. His answer shows the power of an overriding desire.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/desire.p9" pid="8_K8WtNKmU60DZVAVZt_sA" hash="6OZ8GA">“I knew that if we ever got home, I would be meeting the parents of those boys on the streets in our small town, and I didn’t want to face any of them if their son didn’t make it home because of anything I failed to do as his commander.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/desire.p10" pid="yYbnFvCAEUi6QTiMBK8I4g" hash="SJ1dLg">What an example of the power of an overriding desire on priorities and on actions! What a powerful example for all of us who are responsible for the welfare of others—parents, Church leaders, and teachers!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/desire.p11" pid="cfKUQ69WTEWaiwWqoqdYng" hash="4woSuA">As a conclusion to that illustration, early in the morning following his nearly sleepless night, Captain Cox led his men in a counterattack on the enemy infantry. They took over 800 prisoners and suffered only two wounded. Cox was decorated for bravery, and his battery received a Presidential Unit Citation for its extraordinary heroism. And, like Helaman’s stripling warriors (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/57.25-26" class="scriptureRef">Alma 57:25–26</a>), they all made it home.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/desire.p12" pid="xoazl5FfQ0KZEE6rz129ig" hash="S5Vl-g">The Book of Mormon contains many teachings on the importance of desire.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/desire.p13" pid="v9Gsyyal9kimfSU5gJ4O7g" hash="DTCqGg">After many hours of pleading with the Lord, Enos was told that his sins were forgiven. He then “began to feel a desire for the welfare of [his] brethren” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.9" class="scriptureRef">Enos 1:9</a>). He wrote, “And … after I had prayed and labored with all diligence, the Lord said unto me: I will grant unto thee according to thy desires, because of thy faith” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.12" class="scriptureRef">verse 12</a>). Note the three essentials that preceded the promised blessing: desire, labor, and faith.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/desire.p14" pid="s-miyeFsIUeEiRIoKwlw6w" hash="iQXB3g">In his sermon on faith, Alma teaches that faith can begin with “no more than [a] desire to believe” if we will “let this desire work in [us]” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.27" class="scriptureRef">Alma 32:27</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/desire.p15" pid="SfJWFUvCIkyQR2Uoy4iEHQ" hash="04PYdQ">Another great teaching on desire, especially on what should be our ultimate desire, occurs in the experience of the Lamanite king being taught by the missionary Aaron. When Aaron’s teaching caught his interest, the king asked, “What shall I do that I may be born of God” and “have this eternal life?” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/22.15" class="scriptureRef">Alma 22:15</a>). Aaron replied, “If thou desirest this thing, … if thou wilt repent of all thy sins, and will bow down before God, and call on his name in faith, believing that ye shall receive, then shalt thou receive the hope which thou desirest” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/22.16" class="scriptureRef">verse 16</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/desire.p16" pid="7oDwiP0LOkWCfVOh5EbCfg" hash="PttJAg">The king did so and in mighty prayer declared, “I will give away all my sins to know thee … and be saved at the last day” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/22.18" class="scriptureRef">verse 18</a>). With that commitment and that identification of his ultimate desire, his prayer was answered miraculously.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/desire.p17" pid="5MTZbToFxE2MgfB6oKA38w" hash="M-osog">The prophet Alma had a great desire to cry repentance to all people, but he came to understand that he should not desire the compelling power this would require because, he concluded, “a just God … granteth unto men according to their desire, whether it be unto death or unto life” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/29.4" class="scriptureRef">Alma 29:4</a>). Similarly, in modern revelation the Lord declares that He “will judge all men according to their works, according to the desire of their hearts” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/137.9" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 137:9</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/desire.p18" pid="ostKxWo3WUOgYYr9PPYGxA" hash="M0546Q">Are we truly prepared to have our Eternal Judge attach this enormous significance to what we really desire?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/desire.p19" pid="L347Mvx0bEi42hK-YDVbMQ" hash="Tr5Q-w">Many scriptures speak of what we desire in terms of what we seek. “He that seeketh me early shall find me, and shall not be forsaken” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.83" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:83</a>). “Seek ye earnestly the best gifts” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/46.8" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 46:8</a>). “He that diligently seeketh shall find” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/10.19" class="scriptureRef">1 Nephi 10:19</a>). “Draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you; seek me diligently and ye shall find me; ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.63" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:63</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/desire.p20" pid="kZ-1fq2qO0K-U6twDfvlug" hash="1MwlpA">Readjusting our desires to give highest priority to the things of eternity is not easy. We are all tempted to desire that worldly quartet of property, prominence, pride, and power. We might desire these, but we should not fix them as our highest priorities.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/desire.p21" pid="Hk3-b7S_kUuUPrpSZTSqNA" hash="76PMqA">Those whose highest desire is to acquire possessions fall into the trap of materialism. They fail to heed the warning “Seek not after riches nor the vain things of this world” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/39.14" class="scriptureRef">Alma 39:14</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2.18" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 2:18</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/desire.p22" pid="7kfK-iy5j0a3_sFDcMCmpA" hash="5g0EYw">Those who desire prominence or power should follow the example of the valiant Captain Moroni, whose service was not “for power” or for the “honor of the world” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/60.36" class="scriptureRef">Alma 60:36</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/desire.p23" pid="MKOnuM_pD0WL382mk0FjMg" hash="W3nq7Q">How do we develop desires? Few will have the kind of crisis that motivated Aron Ralston,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> but his experience provides a valuable lesson about developing desires. While Ralston was hiking in a remote canyon in southern Utah, an 800-pound (360 kg) rock shifted suddenly and trapped his right arm. For five lonely days he struggled to free himself. When he was about to give up and accept death, he had a vision of a three-year-old boy running toward him and being scooped up with his left arm. Understanding this as a vision of his future son and an assurance that he could still live, Ralston summoned the courage and took drastic action to save his life before his strength ran out. He broke the two bones in his trapped right arm and then used the knife in his multitool to cut off that arm. He then summoned the strength to hike five miles (8 km) for help.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> What an example of the power of an overwhelming desire! When we have a vision of what we can become, our desire and our power to act increase enormously.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/desire.p24" pid="7ObMc3iXLE6Gv0MZP_6rew" hash="8nhx5w">Most of us will never face such an extreme crisis, but all of us face potential traps that will prevent progress toward our eternal destiny. If our righteous desires are sufficiently intense, they will motivate us to cut and carve ourselves free from addictions and other sinful pressures and priorities that prevent our eternal progress.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/desire.p25" pid="SbvGLsku7UOln6R2LzjEdg" hash="58U4Rg">We should remember that righteous desires cannot be superficial, impulsive, or temporary. They must be heartfelt, unwavering, and permanent. So motivated, we will seek for that condition described by the Prophet Joseph Smith, where we have “overcome the evils of [our lives] and lost every desire for sin.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> That is a very personal decision. As Elder Neal A. Maxwell said:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/desire.p26" pid="nXuX-iH46USknCedlICI8A" hash="N3Sb7A"> “When people are described as ‘having lost their desire for sin,’ it is they, and they only, who deliberately decided to lose those wrong desires by being willing to ‘give away all [their] sins’ in order to know God.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/desire.p27" pid="R4rJP9NMkU6hV9m38uKnEA" hash="rPSjLw"> “Therefore, what we insistently desire, over time, is what we will eventually become and what we will receive in eternity.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/desire.p28" pid="LkMtbqb0h0CNqtJxCQ6gww" hash="hz9W_Q">As important as it is to lose every desire for sin, eternal life requires more. To achieve our eternal destiny, we will desire and work for the qualities required to become an eternal being. For example, eternal beings forgive all who have wronged them. They put the welfare of others ahead of themselves. And they love all of God’s children. If this seems too difficult—and surely it is not easy for any of us—then we should begin with a desire for such qualities and call upon our loving Heavenly Father for help with our feelings. The Book of Mormon teaches us that we should “pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that [we] may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.48" class="scriptureRef">Moroni 7:48</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/desire.p29" pid="pR8VogYF9UuGvzqKJ-kqnw" hash="_yGsRA">I close with a final example of a desire that should be paramount for all men and women—those who are currently married and those who are single. All should desire and seriously work to secure a marriage for eternity. Those who already have a temple marriage should do all they can to preserve it. Those who are single should desire a temple marriage and exert priority efforts to obtain it. Youth and young singles should resist the politically correct but eternally false concept that discredits the importance of marrying and having children.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/desire.p30" pid="25FUqMmBDkqwuClTC1r_3w" hash="F7XzNQ">Single men, please consider the challenge in this letter written by a single sister. She pleaded for “the righteous daughters of God that are sincerely searching for a worthy helpmeet, yet the men seem to be blinded and confused as to whether or not it is their responsibility to seek out these wonderful, choice daughters of our Heavenly Father and court them and be willing to make and keep sacred covenants in the Lord’s house.” She concluded, “There are many single LDS men here that are happy to go out and have fun, and date and hang out, but have absolutely no desire to ever make any kind of commitment to a woman.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/desire.p31" pid="YtGpUEVHNEur04qQiA__nQ" hash="_CvoWg">I am sure that some anxiously seeking young men would want me to add that there are some young women whose desires for a worthy marriage and children rank far below their desires for a career or other mortal distinctions. Both men and women need righteous desires that will lead them to eternal life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/desire.p32" pid="G3FnFbQPQUuzaEmliRpEcg" hash="o6gJCw">Let us remember that desires dictate our priorities, priorities shape our choices, and choices determine our actions. In addition, it is our actions and our desires that cause us to become something, whether a true friend, a gifted teacher, or one who has qualified for eternal life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/desire.p33" pid="e0y7OLSwSkqrVgQZ2PZ0GA" hash="lTIOxw">I testify of Jesus Christ, whose love, whose teachings, and whose Atonement make it all possible. I pray that above all else we will desire to become like Him so that one day we can return to His presence to receive the fulness of His joy. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

With those words Jesus confounded the Pharisees of His day. With those same words I ask my fellow Latter-day Saints and other Christians what you really believe about Jesus Christ and what you are doing because of that belief.</p>

My interpretations will of course draw on what modern scripture, notably the Book of Mormon, teaches us about the meaning of Bible scriptures so ambiguous that different Christians disagree on their meaning. I address believers but others as well. As Elder Tad R. Callister taught us this morning, some who call themselves Christians praise Jesus as a great teacher but refrain from affirming His divinity. To address them, I have used the words of Jesus Himself. We should all consider what He Himself taught about who He is and what He was sent to earth to do.</p>

In His great sermon on the bread of life, Jesus explained the contrast between mortal and eternal nourishment. “Labour not for the meat which perisheth,” He said, “but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/6.27" class="scriptureRef">John 6:27</a>). The Savior taught that He was the Bread of Life, the source of eternal nourishment. Speaking of the mortal nourishment the world offered, including the manna Jehovah had sent to feed the children of Israel in the wilderness, Jesus taught that those who relied on this bread were now dead (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/6.49" class="scriptureRef">John 6:49</a>). In contrast, the nourishment He offered was “the living bread which came down from heaven,” and, Jesus taught, “if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/6.51" class="scriptureRef">John 6:51</a>).</p>

It was prefigured by the animal sacrifices prescribed by the law of Moses. A prophet declared that their whole meaning “point[ed] to that great and last sacrifice [of] … the Son of God, yea, infinite and eternal” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.14" class="scriptureRef">Alma 34:14</a>). Jesus Christ endured incomprehensible suffering to make Himself a sacrifice for the sins of all. That sacrifice offered the ultimate good—the pure Lamb without blemish—for the ultimate measure of evil—the sins of the entire world. In the memorable words of Eliza R. Snow:</p>

    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/sacrifice.p11" pid="WDtvKDaYf0ehus5i7VcFvg" hash="8ZZTZw">The incomprehensible suffering of Jesus Christ ended sacrifice by the shedding of blood, but it did not end the importance of sacrifice in the gospel plan. Our Savior requires us to continue to offer sacrifices, but the sacrifices He now commands are that we “offer for a sacrifice unto [Him] a broken heart and a contrite spirit” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.20" class="scriptureRef">3 Nephi 9:20</a>). He also commands each of us to love and serve one another—in effect, to offer a small imitation of His own sacrifice by making sacrifices of our own time and selfish priorities. In an inspired hymn, we sing, “Sacrifice brings forth the blessings of heaven.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

This will not include sacrifices we are compelled to make or actions that may be motivated by personal advantage rather than service or sacrifice (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.29" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 26:29</a>).</p>

In the early years of the Christian era, Rome martyred thousands for their faith in Jesus Christ. In later centuries, as doctrinal controversies divided Christians, some groups persecuted and even put to death the members of other groups. Christians killed by other Christians are the most tragic martyrs of the Christian faith.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/sacrifice.p15" pid="cJasMahpz0ewR7tFUiF7qw" hash="Q7h9Fg">Many Christians have voluntarily given sacrifices motivated by faith in Christ and the desire to serve Him. Some have chosen to devote their entire adult lives to the service of the Master. This noble group includes those in the religious orders of the Catholic Church and those who have given lifelong service as Christian missionaries in various Protestant faiths. Their examples are challenging and inspiring, but most believers in Christ are neither expected nor able to devote their entire lives to religious service.</p>

In that experience I know of no group whose members make more sacrifices than Latter-day Saints. Their sacrifices—your sacrifices, my brothers and sisters—stand in contrast to the familiar worldly quests for personal fulfillment.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/sacrifice.p18" pid="TFuhFMUm3UqEcIg326nDFw" hash="9PUaVw">My first examples are our Mormon pioneers. Their epic sacrifices of lives, family relationships, homes, and comforts are at the foundation of the restored gospel. Sarah Rich spoke for what motivated these pioneers when she described her husband, Charles, being called away on a mission: “This truly was a trying time for me as well as for my husband; but duty called us to part for a season and knowing that we [were] obeying the will of the Lord, we felt to sacrifice our own feelings in order to help establish the work … of helping to build up the Kingdom of God on earth.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

Prior to the <span class="pageBreak" page-number="20"></span>rededication of one of our temples, a Christian minister asked President Gordon B. Hinckley why it did not contain any representation of the cross, the most common symbol of the Christian faith.

As a result, the lay members who are called to lead and serve our congregations must carry the whole load of our numerous Church meetings, programs, and activities. They do this in more than 14,000 congregations just in the United States and Canada. Of course, we are not unique in having lay members of our congregations serve as teachers and lay leaders. But the amount of time donated by our members to train and minister to one another is uniquely large. Our efforts to have each family in our congregations visited by home teachers each month and to have each adult woman visited by Relief Society visiting teachers each month are examples of this. We know of no comparable service in any organization in the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/sacrifice.p22" pid="HNQXWJOsokaBHECDibGPYA" hash="XTY4vQ">The best-known examples of unique LDS service and sacrifice are the work of our missionaries. Currently they number more than 50,000 young men and young women and over 5,000 adult men and women. They devote from six months to two years of their lives to teaching the gospel of Jesus Christ and providing humanitarian service in more than 160 countries in the world. Their work always involves sacrifice, including the years they give to the work of the Lord and also the sacrifices made in providing funds for their support.</p>

For example, a young Brazilian received a missionary call while he was working to support his brothers and sisters after his father and mother died. A General Authority described these children’s meeting in council and remembering that their deceased parents had taught them that they should always be prepared to serve the Lord. The young man accepted his missionary call, and a 16-year-old brother took over the responsibility of working to support the family.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> Most of us know of many other examples of sacrifice to serve a mission or to support a missionary. We know of no other voluntary service and sacrifice like this in any other organization in the world.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/sacrifice.p24" pid="Zn3hnHx4SE222IoOlGSr4g" hash="NjhLDQ">We are frequently asked, “How do you persuade your young people and your older members to leave their schooling or their retirement to sacrifice in this way?” I have heard many give this explanation: “Knowing what my <span class="pageBreak" page-number="21"></span>Savior did for me—His grace in suffering for my sins and in overcoming death so I can live again—I feel privileged to make the small sacrifice I am asked to make in His service. I want to share the understanding He has given me.” How do we persuade such followers of Christ to serve? As a prophet explained, “We [just] ask them.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/sacrifice.p25" pid="Ml6xTf0EfEucWICWi_FLTA" hash="Hm_L-A">Other sacrifices resulting from missionary service are the sacrifices of those who act on the teachings of the missionaries and become members of the Church. For many converts, these sacrifices are very significant, including the loss of friends and family associations.</p>

        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/sacrifice.p26" pid="F0TIxA15Gk2Qz9yx_ZLUrQ" hash="URY2cg">Many years ago this conference heard of a young man who found the restored gospel while he was studying in the United States. As this man was about to return to his native land, President Gordon B. Hinckley asked him what would happen to him when he returned home as a Christian. “My family will be disappointed,” the young man answered. “They may cast me out and regard me as dead. As for my future and my career, all opportunity may be foreclosed against me.”</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/sacrifice.p29" pid="OoryfsTTAEGNvygLSnI4yQ" hash="8POV6A">Other examples of service and sacrifice appear in the lives of the faithful members who serve in our temples. Temple service is unique to Latter-day Saints, but the significance of such sacrifice should be understandable to all Christians. Latter-day Saints have no tradition of service in a monastery, but we can still understand and honor the sacrifice of those whose Christian faith motivates them to devote their lives to that religious activity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/sacrifice.p30" pid="HPm3pe3zEk-XItHEhtTVpA" hash="93EnvQ">In this conference just a year ago, President Thomas S. Monson shared an example of sacrifice in connection with temple service. A faithful Latter-day Saint father on a remote island in the Pacific did heavy physical work in a faraway place for six years to earn the money necessary to take his wife and 10 children for marriage and sealing for eternity in the New Zealand Temple. President Monson explained, “Those who understand the eternal blessings which come from the temple know that no sacrifice is too great, no price too heavy, no struggle too difficult in <span class="pageBreak" page-number="22"></span>order to receive those blessings.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>

I see you performing your Church callings, often at great sacrifice of time and means. I see you serving missions at your own expense. I see you cheerfully donating your professional skills in service to your fellowmen. I see you caring for the poor through personal efforts and through supporting Church welfare and humanitarian contributions.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> All of this is affirmed in a nationwide study which concluded that active members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints “volunteer and donate significantly more than the average American and are even more generous in time and money than the upper [20 percent] of religious people in America.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span></p>

Latter-day Saints look on their sacrifices of time and means as a part of their schooling and qualifying for eternity. This is a truth revealed in the <span class="emphasis">Lectures on Faith,</span> which teach that “a religion that does not require the sacrifice of all things never has power sufficient to produce the faith necessary unto life and salvation. … It [is] through this sacrifice, and this only, that God has ordained that men should enjoy eternal life.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span></p>

      <span class="pageBreak" page-number="43"></span>We can all remember our feelings when a little child cried out and reached up to us for help. A loving Heavenly Father gives us those feelings to impel us to help His children. Please recall those feelings as I speak about our responsibility to protect and act for the well-being of children.</p>

That is my calling. Local Church leaders have responsibility for a single jurisdiction, like a ward or stake, but an Apostle is responsible to witness to the entire world. In every nation, of every race and creed, all children are children of God.</p>

We are all under the Savior’s command to love and care for each other and especially for the weak and defenseless.</p>

They have little or no power to protect or provide for themselves and little influence on so much that is vital to their well-being. Children need others to speak for them, and they need decision makers who put their well-being ahead of selfish adult interests.</p>

This is a worldwide trend. The national birthrate in the United States is the lowest in 25 years,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> and the birthrates in most European and Asian countries have been below replacement levels for many years. This is not just a religious issue. As rising generations diminish in numbers, cultures and even nations are hollowed out and eventually disappear.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/protect-the-children.p14" pid="dw0wsiRCXE2QdY3izCeFew" hash="ESEY9w">One cause of the diminishing birthrate is the practice of abortion. Worldwide, there are estimated to be more than 40 million abortions per year.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> Many laws permit or even promote abortion, but to us this is a great evil. Other abuses of children that occur during pregnancy are the fetal impairments that result from the mother’s inadequate nutrition or drug use.</p>

The general presidency of the Primary report children living in conditions “beyond our imaginations.” A mother in the Philippines said: “Sometimes we do not have enough money for food, but that is all right because it gives me the opportunity to teach my children about faith. We gather and pray for relief, and the children see the Lord bless us.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> In South Africa, a Primary worker met a little girl, lonely and sad. In faint responses to loving questions, she said she had no mother, no father, and no grandmother—only a grandfather to care for her.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> Such tragedies are common on a continent where many caregivers have died of AIDS.</p>

Children growing up in poverty have inferior health care and inadequate educational opportunities. They are also exposed to dangerous environments in their physical and cultural surroundings and even from the neglect of their parents. Elder <span class="pageBreak" page-number="44"></span>Jeffrey R. Holland recently shared the experience of an LDS police officer. In an investigation he found five young children huddled together and trying to sleep without bedding on a filthy floor in a dwelling where their mother and others were drinking and partying. The apartment had no food to relieve their hunger. After tucking the children into a makeshift bed, the officer knelt and prayed for their protection. As he walked toward the door, one of them, about six, pursued him, grabbed him by the hand, and pleaded, “Will you please adopt me?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/protect-the-children.p25" pid="ip7Cx6wGZ0qX3p5A08XXFg" hash="mWxxuA">Of utmost importance to the well-being of children is whether their parents were married, the nature and duration of the marriage, and, more broadly, the culture and expectations of marriage and child care where they live. Two scholars of the family explain: “Throughout history, marriage has first and foremost been an institution for procreation and raising children. It has provided the cultural tie that seeks to connect the father to his children by binding him to the mother of his children. Yet in recent times, children have increasingly been pushed from center stage.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/protect-the-children.p26" pid="IY05oXwqxk-pbcnr0lpcEg" hash="d6warA">A Harvard law professor describes the current law and attitude toward marriage and divorce: “The [current] American story about marriage, as told in the law and in much popular literature, goes something like this: marriage is a relationship that exists primarily for the fulfillment of the individual spouses. If it ceases to perform this function, no one is to blame and either spouse may terminate it at will. … Children hardly appear in the story; at most they are rather shadowy characters in the background.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/protect-the-children.p27" pid="a2b5-JAqhkuGWCFjg1W1eg" hash="GfNNgQ">Our Church leaders have taught that looking “upon marriage as a mere contract that may be entered into at pleasure … and severed at the first difficulty … is an evil meriting severe condemnation,” especially where “children are made to suffer.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span> And children are impacted by divorces. Over half of the divorces in a recent year involved couples with minor children.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/protect-the-children.p28" pid="3iKn4q3qTkycCHyJmzst3A" hash="II5rxQ">Many children would have had the blessing of being raised by both of their parents if only their parents had followed this inspired teaching in the family proclamation: “Husband and wife have a solemn responsibility to love and care for each other and for their children. … Parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness, to provide for their physical and spiritual needs, and to teach them to love and serve one another.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span> The most powerful teaching of children is by the example <span class="pageBreak" page-number="45"></span>of their parents. Divorcing parents inevitably teach a negative lesson.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/protect-the-children.p29" pid="lW3-3U4ZQUeAQnBhotBIwQ" hash="6hImjA">There are surely cases when a divorce is necessary for the good of the children, but those circumstances are exceptional.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span> In most marital contests the contending parents should give much greater weight to the interests of the children. With the help of the Lord, they can do so. Children need the emotional and personal strength that come from being raised by two parents who are united in their marriage and their goals. As one who was raised by a widowed mother, I know firsthand that this cannot always be achieved, but it is the ideal to be sought whenever possible.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/protect-the-children.p30" pid="gRSpJ72h4UC_Emgq1N1bgQ" hash="xc1_lg">Children are the first victims of current laws permitting so-called “no-fault divorce.” From the standpoint of children, divorce is too easy. Summarizing decades of social science research, a careful scholar concluded that “the family structure that produces the best outcomes for children, on average, are two biological parents who remain married.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18">18</span> A <span class="emphasis">New York Times</span> writer noted “the striking fact that even as traditional marriage has declined in the United States … the evidence has mounted for the institution’s importance to the well-being of children.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span> That reality should give important guidance to parents and parents-to-be in their decisions involving marriage and divorce. We also need politicians, policy makers, and officials to increase their attention to what is best for children in contrast to the selfish interests of voters and vocal advocates of adult interests.</p>

They will be obedient, as President Thomas S. Monson taught this morning. Following Christ is not a casual or occasional practice but a continuous commitment and way of life that applies at all times and in all places. The Savior taught this principle and how we should be reminded and strengthened to follow it when He instituted the ordinance of the sacrament (communion, as others call it). We know from modern revelation that He commanded His followers to partake of the emblems in remembrance of Him (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/26.26c" class="scriptureRef">Joseph Smith Translation, Matthew 26:22</a> [in Matthew 26:26, footnote <span class="emphasis">c</span>], <a href="/scriptures/jst/jst-matt/26.24" class="scriptureRef">24</a> [in the Bible appendix]; <a href="/scriptures/jst/jst-mark/14.21-24" class="scriptureRef">Joseph Smith Translation, Mark 14:21–24</a> [in the Bible appendix]). Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints follow that commandment each week by attending a worship service in which we partake of the bread and water and covenant that we will always remember Him and keep His commandments.</p>

He also set that example, such as when He “continued all night in prayer to God” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/6.12" class="scriptureRef">Luke 6:12</a>) before He called His Twelve Apostles. Like other Christians, we pray in all our worship services. We also pray for guidance, and we teach that we should have frequent personal prayers and daily kneeling prayers as a family. Like Jesus, we pray to our Father in Heaven, and we do so in the sacred name of Jesus Christ.</p>

While many struggle with this difficult commandment, we all know of inspiring examples of Latter-day Saints who have given loving forgiveness, even for the most serious wrongs. For example, Chris Williams drew upon his faith in Jesus Christ to forgive the drunken driver who caused the death of his wife and two of their children.

Our members make generous contributions to charities and give personal service and other gifts to the poor and needy. In addition, our members fast for two meals each month and donate at least the cost of these meals as a fast offering, which our bishops and branch presidents use to help our needy members.

This means, as we are told in the New Testament, that we are “heirs … of eternal life” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/titus/3.7" class="scriptureRef">Titus 3:7</a>) and that if we come to the Father, we are to “inherit all things” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/21.7" class="scriptureRef">Revelation 21:7</a>)—all that He has—a concept our mortal minds can hardly grasp.

Given by God to the children of Israel through the prophet Moses, the first two of these commandments direct our worship and our priorities. In the first, the Lord commanded, “Thou shalt have no other gods before me” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/20.3" class="scriptureRef">Exodus 20:3</a>). Centuries later, when Jesus was asked, “Which is the great commandment in the law?” He answered, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/22.36-37" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 22:36–37</a>).</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/no-other-gods.p6" pid="yQLACSbnqESu7kjgecF6XQ" hash="ep3MIg">The second of the Ten Commandments elaborates the direction to have no other gods and identifies what should be the ultimate priority in our lives as His children. “Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing” in the heavens or the earth (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/20.4" class="scriptureRef">Exodus 20:4</a>). The commandment then adds, “Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/20.5" class="scriptureRef">Exodus 20:5</a>). More than merely forbidding physical idols, this states a fundamental priority for all time. Jehovah explains, “For I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, … shewing mercy unto … them that love me, and keep my commandments” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/20.5-6" class="scriptureRef">Exodus 20:5–6</a>). The meaning of <span class="emphasis">jealous</span> is revealing. Its Hebrew origin means “possessing sensitive and deep feelings” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/20.5" class="scriptureRef">Exodus 20:5</a>, footnote <span class="emphasis">b</span>). Thus we offend God when we “serve” other gods—when we have other first priorities.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

The plan of salvation explains the purpose of creation and the conditions of mortality, including God’s commandments, the need for a Savior, and the vital role of mortal and eternal families. If we Latter-day Saints, who have been given this knowledge, do not establish our priorities in accord with this plan, we are in danger of serving other gods.</p>

We know this is possible only in a family relationship. We know that the marriage of a man and a woman is necessary for the accomplishment of God’s plan. Only this marriage will provide the approved setting for mortal birth and to prepare family members for eternal life. We look on marriage and the bearing and nurturing of children as part of God’s plan and a sacred duty of those given the opportunity to do so.

The emphasis we place on the law of chastity is explained by our understanding of the purpose of our procreative powers in the accomplishment of God’s plan.

Commitment to our highest priority—to love and serve God—requires that we look to His law for our standard of behavior. For example, we remain under divine command not to commit adultery or fornication even when those acts are no longer crimes under the laws of the states or countries where we reside. Similarly, laws legalizing so-called “same-sex marriage” do not change God’s law of marriage or His commandments and our standards concerning it.

				<span class="pageBreak" page-number="49"></span>At this conference we have seen the release of some faithful brothers, and we have sustained the callings of others. In this rotation—so familiar in the Church—we do not “step down” when we are released, and we do not “step up” when we are called. There is no “up or down” in the service of the Lord. There is only “forward or backward,” and that difference depends on how we accept and act upon our releases and our callings. I once presided at the release of a young stake president who had given fine service for nine years and was now rejoicing in his release and in the new calling he and his wife had just received. They were called to be the nursery leaders in their ward. Only in this Church would that be seen as equally honorable!</p>

It enlarges by making it possible for priesthood authority and blessings to be available for all of God’s children. It limits by directing who will be given the authority of the priesthood, who will hold its offices, and how its <span class="pageBreak" page-number="50"></span>rights and powers will be conferred. For example, a person who holds the priesthood is not able to confer his office or authority on another unless authorized by one who holds the keys. Without that authorization, the ordination would be invalid. This explains why a priesthood holder—regardless of office—cannot ordain a member of his family or administer the sacrament in his own home without authorization from the one who holds the appropriate keys.</p>

He is the one who determines what keys are delegated to mortals and how those keys will be used. We are accustomed to thinking that all keys of the priesthood were conferred on Joseph Smith in the Kirtland Temple, but the scripture states that all that was conferred there were “the keys of this dispensation” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/110.16" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 110:16</a>). At general conference many years ago, President Spencer W.

The First Presidency and the Council of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve, who preside over the Church, are empowered to make many decisions affecting Church policies and procedures—matters such as the location of Church buildings and the ages for missionary service. But even though these presiding authorities hold and exercise all of the keys delegated to men in this dispensation, they are not free to alter the divinely decreed pattern that only men will hold offices in the priesthood.</p>

I begin with the three principles just discussed: (1) priesthood is the power of God delegated to man to act for the salvation of the human family, (2) priesthood authority is governed by priesthood holders who hold priesthood keys, and (3) since the scriptures state that “all other authorities [and] offices in the church are appendages to this [Melchizedek] priesthood” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.5" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 107:5</a>), all that is done under the direction of those priesthood keys is done with priesthood authority.</p>

In an address to the Relief Society, President Joseph Fielding Smith, then President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, said this: “While the sisters have not been given the Priesthood, it has not been conferred upon them, that does not mean that the Lord has not given unto them authority. … A person may have authority given to him, or a sister to her, to do certain things in the Church that are binding and absolutely necessary for our salvation, such as the work that our sisters do in the House of the Lord. They have authority given unto them to do some great and wonderful things, sacred unto the Lord, and binding just as thoroughly as are the blessings that are given by the men who hold the Priesthood.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span>

To the women he said, “You can speak with authority, because the Lord has placed authority upon you.” He also said that the Relief Society “[has] been given power and authority to do a great many things. The work which they do is done by divine authority.” And, of course, the Church work done by women or men, whether in the temple or in the wards or branches, is done under the direction of those who hold priesthood keys. Thus, speaking of the Relief Society, President Smith explained, “[The Lord] has given to them this great organization where they have authority to serve under the directions of the bishops of the wards … , looking after the interest of our people both spiritually and temporally.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span>

When a woman—young or old—is set apart to preach the gospel as a full-time missionary, she is given priesthood authority to perform a priesthood function. The same is true when a woman is set apart to function as an officer or teacher in a Church organization under the direction of one who holds the keys of the priesthood. Whoever functions in an office or calling received from one who holds priesthood keys exercises priesthood authority in performing her or his assigned duties.</p>

					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/loving-others-and-living-with-differences.p6" pid="uMtiOHdZ90KbKfdqPDDESg" hash="oqndlA">In the concluding days of His mortal ministry, Jesus gave His disciples what He called “a new commandment” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/13.34" class="scriptureRef">John 13:34</a>). Repeated three times, that commandment was simple but difficult: “Love one another, as I have loved you” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/15.12" class="scriptureRef">John 15:12</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/15.17" class="scriptureRef">verse 17</a>). The teaching to love one another had been a central teaching of the Savior’s ministry. The second great commandment was “love thy neighbour as thyself” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/22.39" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 22:39</a>). Jesus even taught, “Love your enemies” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.44" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 5:44</a>). But the commandment to <span class="emphasis">love others as He had loved His flock</span> was to His disciples—and is to us—a challenge that was unique. “Actually,” President Thomas S. Monson taught us last April, “love is the very essence of the gospel, and Jesus Christ is our Exemplar. His life was a legacy of love.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/loving-others-and-living-with-differences.p7" pid="zZPD7QluMkCMakD1uZem-A" hash="xFOItw">Why is it so difficult to have Christlike love for one another? It is difficult because we must live among those who do not share our beliefs and values and covenant obligations. In His great Intercessory Prayer, offered just before His Crucifixion, Jesus prayed for His followers: “I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/17.14" class="scriptureRef">John 17:14</a>). Then, to the Father He pleaded, “I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/17.15" class="scriptureRef">verse 15</a>).</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/loving-others-and-living-with-differences.p8" pid="rtFrowxt1E-I4vVcliBZkg" hash="O16mQw">We are to live <span class="emphasis">in</span> the world but not be <span class="emphasis">of</span> the world. We must live in the world because, as Jesus taught in a parable, His kingdom is “like leaven,” whose function is to raise the whole mass by its influence (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/13.21" class="scriptureRef">Luke 13:21</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/13.33" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 13:33</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/5.6-8" class="scriptureRef">1 Corinthians 5:6–8</a>). His followers cannot do that if they associate only with those who share their beliefs and practices. But the Savior also taught that if we love Him, we will keep His commandments (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.15" class="scriptureRef">John 14:15</a>).</p>

					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/loving-others-and-living-with-differences.p10" pid="bOXgJCJsQUaxt0PdBtA34w" hash="RjR5HQ">The gospel has many teachings about keeping the commandments while living among people with different beliefs and practices. The teachings about contention are central. When the resurrected Christ found the Nephites disputing over the manner of baptism, He gave clear directions on how this ordinance should be performed. Then He taught this great principle:</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/loving-others-and-living-with-differences.p11" pid="EWc74lpHY0yy_U8HnHHVTA" hash="JakyDw">“There shall be no disputations among you, as there have hitherto been; neither shall there be disputations among you concerning the points of my doctrine, as there have hitherto been.</p>

					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/loving-others-and-living-with-differences.p14" pid="yv2S51pw70avSXAhsjfq2g" hash="j5PK1Q">The Savior did not limit His warning against contention to those who were not keeping the commandment about baptism. He forbade contention by anyone. Even those who keep the commandments must not stir up the hearts of men to contend with anger. The “father of contention” is the devil; the Savior is the Prince of Peace.</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/loving-others-and-living-with-differences.p15" pid="J16qhMWQXkWuQR0MnT5rPg" hash="Vf4YtA">Similarly, the Bible teaches that “wise men turn away wrath” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/prov/29.8" class="scriptureRef">Proverbs 29:8</a>). The early Apostles taught that we should “follow after the things [that] make for peace” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/14.19" class="scriptureRef">Romans 14:19</a>) and “[speak] the truth in love” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/4.15" class="scriptureRef">Ephesians 4:15</a>), “for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/1.20" class="scriptureRef">James 1:20</a>). In modern revelation the Lord commanded that the glad tidings of the restored gospel should be declared “every man to his neighbor, in mildness and in meekness” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38.41" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 38:41</a>), “with all humility, … reviling not against revilers” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19.30" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 19:30</a>).</p>

We must not surrender our positions or our values. The gospel of Jesus Christ and the covenants we have made inevitably cast us as combatants in the eternal contest between truth and error. There is no middle ground in that contest.</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/loving-others-and-living-with-differences.p18" pid="4rpEDv3K50ChDOzq0f3YoA" hash="qEI6iA">The Savior showed the way when His adversaries confronted Him with the woman who had been “taken in adultery, in the very act” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/8.4" class="scriptureRef">John 8:4</a>). When shamed with their own hypocrisy, the accusers withdrew and left Jesus alone with the woman. He treated her with kindness by declining to condemn her at that time. But He also firmly directed her to “sin no more” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/8.11" class="scriptureRef">John 8:11</a>). Loving-kindness is required, but a follower of Christ—just like the Master—will be firm in the truth.</p>

Prominent among these today is the strong tide that is legalizing same-sex marriage in many states and provinces in the United States and Canada and many other countries in the world. We also live among some who don’t believe in marriage at all. Some don’t believe in having children. Some oppose any restrictions on pornography or dangerous drugs. Another example—familiar to most believers—is the challenge of living with a nonbelieving spouse or family member or associating with nonbelieving fellow workers.</p>

Our right to do so is protected by constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and religion, as well as by the privacy that is honored even in countries without formal constitutional guarantees.</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/loving-others-and-living-with-differences.p22" pid="1qATUB44Q0GT2b7J_hhr9A" hash="rY0klA">In public, what religious persons say and do involves other considerations. The free exercise of religion covers most public actions, but it is subject to qualifications necessary to accommodate the beliefs and practices of others. Laws can prohibit behavior that is generally recognized as wrong or unacceptable, like sexual exploitation, violence, or terrorist behavior, even when done by extremists in the name of religion. Less grievous behaviors, even though unacceptable to some believers, may simply need to be endured if legalized by what a Book of Mormon prophet called “the voice of the people” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/29.26" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 29:26</a>).</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/loving-others-and-living-with-differences.p23" pid="DG6XlyptYESdwst-jtl-Pw" hash="3u8tuA">On the subject of public discourse, we should all follow the gospel teachings to love our neighbor and avoid contention. Followers of Christ should be examples of civility. We should love all people, be good listeners, and show concern for their sincere beliefs. Though we may disagree, we should not be disagreeable. Our stands and communications on controversial topics should not be contentious. We should be wise in explaining and pursuing our positions and in exercising our influence. In doing so, we ask that others not be offended by our sincere religious beliefs and the free exercise of our religion. We encourage all of us to practice the Savior’s Golden Rule: “Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/7.12" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 7:12</a>).</p>

Too often non-Mormons here in Utah have been offended and alienated by some of our members who will not allow their children to be friends with children of other faiths. Surely we can teach our children values and standards of behavior without having them distance themselves or show disrespect to any who are different.</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/loving-others-and-living-with-differences.p28" pid="RRxzjkSDa0ahUoYAwCPnaw" hash="9rD_2g">Many teachers in church and school have grieved at the way some teenagers, including LDS youth, treat one another. The commandment to love one another surely includes love and respect across religious lines and also across racial, cultural, and economic lines. We challenge all youth to avoid bullying, insults, or language and practices that deliberately inflict pain on others. All of these violate the Savior’s command to love one another.</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/loving-others-and-living-with-differences.p29" pid="beIa67jPs0uVZ6ZB6jfEDQ" hash="_fWHIA">The Savior taught that contention is a tool of the devil. That surely teaches against some of the current language and practices of politics. Living with policy differences is essential to politics, but policy differences need not involve personal attacks that poison the process of government and punish participants. All of us should banish hateful communications and practice civility for differences of opinion.</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/loving-others-and-living-with-differences.p30" pid="yGm7wXkXo0W7R1A1guDlFg" hash="XcyHaw">The most important setting to forgo contention and practice respect for differences is in our homes and family relationships. Differences are inevitable—some minor and some major. As to major differences, suppose a family member is in a cohabitation relationship. That brings two important values into conflict—our love for the family member and our commitment to the commandments. Following the Savior’s example, we can show loving-kindness and still be firm in the truth by forgoing actions that facilitate or seem to condone what we know to be wrong.</p>

At a stake conference in the Midwest about 10 years ago, I met a sister who told me that her nonmember husband had been accompanying her to church for 12 years but had never joined the Church.

Where vital, our side of these differences should not be denied or abandoned, but as followers of Christ we should live peacefully with others who do not share our values or accept the teachings upon which they are based.

That includes loving our neighbors of different cultures and beliefs as He has loved us. As a Book of Mormon prophet taught, we must press forward, having “a love of God and of all men” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.20" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 31:20</a>).</p>

Many subjects would address the mortal concerns we all share. But just as Jesus did not teach how to overcome the mortal challenges or political oppression of His day, He usually inspires His modern servants to speak about what we must do to reform our personal lives to prepare us to return to our heavenly home. On this Easter weekend I have felt impressed to talk about the precious and timeless teachings in one of the parables of Jesus.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-parable-of-the-sower.p6" pid="eb_ZMGwMVUWTdQlkTt0ujQ" hash="GNzJnQ">The parable of the sower is one of a small number of parables reported in all three of the synoptic Gospels. It is also one of an even smaller group of parables Jesus explained to His disciples. The seed that was sown was “the word of the kingdom” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/13.19" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 13:19</a>), “the word” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/4.14" class="scriptureRef">Mark 4:14</a>), or “the word of God” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/8.11" class="scriptureRef">Luke 8:11</a>)—the teachings of the Master and His servants.</p>

Thus the seeds that “fell by the way side” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/4.4" class="scriptureRef">Mark 4:4</a>) have not reached mortal soil where they might possibly grow. They are like teachings that fall upon a heart hardened or unprepared. I will say nothing more of these. My message concerns those of us who have committed to be followers of Christ. What do we do with the Savior’s teachings as we live our lives?</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-parable-of-the-sower.p10" pid="tSa6gNeazEy-O7kDo05yTw" hash="BhAMJQ">Some seed “fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth: but when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/4.5-6" class="scriptureRef">Mark 4:5–6</a>).</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-parable-of-the-sower.p11" pid="-Oa6s2_TikaW-Bw2mh4Neg" hash="efBoQQ">Jesus explained that this describes those “who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness,” but because they “have no root in themselves, … when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word’s sake, immediately they are offended” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/4.16-17" class="scriptureRef">Mark 4:16–17</a>).</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-parable-of-the-sower.p12" pid="wOT9uHV3x0y8q2lv0nPNqw" hash="5sFmOQ">What causes hearers to “have no root in themselves”? This is the circumstance of new members who are merely converted to the missionaries or to the many attractive characteristics of the Church or to the many great fruits of Church membership. Not being rooted in the word, they can be scorched and wither away when opposition arises. But even those raised in the Church—long-term members—can slip into a condition where they have no root in themselves. I have known some of these—members without firm and lasting conversion to the gospel of Jesus Christ. If we are not rooted in the teachings of the gospel and regular in its practices, any one of us can develop a stony heart, which is stony ground for spiritual seeds.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-parable-of-the-sower.p13" pid="zEmdWrrt906aKzRISkgNLA" hash="PAnaeg">Spiritual food is necessary for spiritual survival, especially in a world that is moving away from belief in God and the absolutes of right and wrong. In an age dominated by the Internet, which magnifies messages that menace faith, we must increase our exposure to spiritual truth in order to strengthen our faith and stay rooted in the gospel.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-parable-of-the-sower.p14" pid="1iO1vv-iUE-xx4M8CcUPwA" hash="H-Hy8g">Young people, if that teaching seems too general, here is a specific example. If the emblems of the sacrament are being passed and you are texting or whispering or playing video games or doing anything else to deny yourself essential spiritual food, you are severing your spiritual roots and moving yourself toward stony ground. You are making yourself vulnerable to withering away when you encounter tribulation like isolation, intimidation, or ridicule. And that applies to adults also.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-parable-of-the-sower.p15" pid="MM91kt_dUEuxil3L5t8A2g" hash="YvEdVg">Another potential destroyer of spiritual roots—accelerated by current technology but not unique to it—is the keyhole view of the gospel or the Church. This limited view focuses on a particular doctrine or practice or perceived deficiency in a leader and ignores the grand panorama of the gospel plan and the personal and communal fruits of its harvest. President Gordon B. Hinckley gave a vivid description of one aspect of this keyhole view. He told a BYU audience about political commentators “aflame with indignation” at a then-recent news event. “With studied art they poured out the sour vinegar of invective and anger. … Surely,” he concluded, “this is the age and place of the gifted pickle sucker.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> In contrast, to be securely rooted in the gospel, we must be moderate and measured in criticism and seek always for the broader view of the majestic work of God.</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-parable-of-the-sower.p17" pid="XaFQEt3DSEOqWVNVLW5N5Q" hash="tBT0EA">Jesus taught that “some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/4.7" class="scriptureRef">Mark 4:7</a>). He explained that these are “such as hear the word, and the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/4.18-19" class="scriptureRef">Mark 4:18–19</a>). This is surely a warning to be heeded by all of us.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-parable-of-the-sower.p18" pid="RIeOqWvC7kyaTBiNTaniAA" hash="T5POZg">I will speak first of the deceitfulness of riches. Wherever we are in our spiritual journey—whatever our state of conversion—we are all tempted by this. When attitudes or priorities are fixed on the acquisition, use, or possession of property, we call that materialism. So much has been said and written about materialism that little needs to be added here.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> Those who believe in what has been called the theology of prosperity are suffering from the deceitfulness of riches. The possession of wealth or significant income is not a mark of heavenly favor, and their absence is not evidence of heavenly disfavor. When Jesus told a faithful follower that he could inherit eternal life if he would only give all that he had to the poor (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/10.17-24" class="scriptureRef">Mark 10:17–24</a>), He was not identifying an evil in the <span class="emphasis">possession</span> of riches but an evil in that follower’s <span class="emphasis">attitude</span> toward them. As we are all aware, Jesus praised the good Samaritan, who used the same coinage to serve his fellowman that Judas used to betray his Savior. The root of all evil is not money but the <span class="emphasis">love of money</span> (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-tim/6.10" class="scriptureRef">1 Timothy 6:10</a>).</p>

Whoever has an abundance of material things is in jeopardy of being spiritually “sedated” by riches and other things of the world.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> That is a suitable introduction to the next of the Savior’s teachings.</p>

These are too numerous to recite. Some examples will suffice.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-parable-of-the-sower.p21" pid="WFf1caUVHkK9mUNcY7ReTA" hash="1p7Psw">On one occasion Jesus rebuked His chief Apostle, saying to Peter, “Thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/16.23" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 16:23</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/3.6-7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 3:6–7</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.39" class="scriptureRef">58:39</a>).

Twenty-five years ago my esteemed BYU teacher Hugh W. Nibley spoke of the dangers of surrendering to the cares of the world.

We achieve this conversion by praying, by scripture reading, by serving, and by regularly partaking of the sacrament to always have His Spirit to be with us.

In his sermon recorded in the Book of Mormon, Alma taught these fundamentals. But he also provided our clearest scriptural assurances that the Savior also experienced the pains and sicknesses and infirmities of His people.</p>

In the Savior’s Atonement, He suffered “pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind.” As President Boyd K. Packer explained: “He had no debt to pay. He had committed no wrong. Nevertheless, an accumulation of all of the guilt, the grief and sorrow, the pain and humiliation, all of the mental, emotional, and physical torments known to man—He experienced them all.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

Alma explained, “And he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.12" class="scriptureRef">Alma 7:12</a>).</p>

Similarly, President James E. Faust taught, “Since the Savior has suffered anything and everything that we could ever feel or experience, He can help the weak to become stronger.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

And because of this, His Atonement empowers Him to succor us—to give us the strength to bear it all.</p>

Some of these, like addictions to pornography or drugs, are likely to have been caused by sinful behavior. Even when that behavior has been repented of, the addiction may remain. That disabling grip can also be relieved by the decisive strength available from the Savior. So can the severe challenge experienced by those sent to prison for crimes.

Our Savior’s Atonement does more than assure us of immortality by a universal resurrection and give us the opportunity to be cleansed from sin by repentance and baptism. His Atonement also provides the opportunity to call upon Him who has experienced all of our mortal infirmities to give us the strength to bear the burdens of mortality. He knows of our anguish, and He is there for us. Like the good Samaritan, when He finds us wounded at the wayside, He will bind up our wounds and care for us (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/10.34" class="scriptureRef">Luke 10:34</a>). The healing and strengthening power of Jesus Christ and His Atonement is for all of us who will ask. I testify of that as I also testify of our Savior, who makes it all possible.</p>

That plan, explained in modern revelation, helps us understand many things we face in mortality. My message focuses on the essential role of opposition in that plan.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;div class="topic" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/opposition-in-all-things.t1"&gt;

			&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/opposition-in-all-things.p7" pid="_w1jt0TDk0aP-AIJqa8mGw" hash="oRVMeQ"&gt;The purpose of mortal life for the children of God is to provide the experiences needed “to progress toward perfection and ultimately realize their divine destiny as heirs of eternal life.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; As President Thomas S. Monson taught us so powerfully this morning, we progress by making choices, by which we are tested to show that we will keep God’s commandments (see &lt;a href="/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.25" class="scriptureRef"&gt;Abraham 3:25&lt;/a&gt;). To be tested, we must have the agency to choose between alternatives. To provide alternatives on which to exercise our agency, we must have opposition.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/opposition-in-all-things.p8" pid="xZO6wZSADkyYf4RtT0b8uA" hash="gKdJ7w"&gt;The rest of the plan is also essential. When we make wrong choices—as we inevitably will—we are soiled by sin and must be cleansed to proceed toward our eternal destiny. The Father’s plan provides the way to do this, the way to satisfy the eternal demands of justice: a Savior pays the price to redeem us from our sins. That Savior is the Lord Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son of God the Eternal Father, whose atoning sacrifice—whose suffering—pays the price for our sins if we will repent of them.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/opposition-in-all-things.p9" pid="Ef4i6qz4xEKBG4rcWS4tOA" hash="Eimtlg"&gt;One of the best explanations of the planned role of opposition is in the Book of Mormon, in Lehi’s teachings to his son Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/opposition-in-all-things.p10" pid="FpQ7Mssjs0mdsqIm_Fa1eg" hash="Msd0bw"&gt;“It must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things. If not so, … righteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery, neither good nor bad” (&lt;a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.11" class="scriptureRef"&gt;2 Nephi 2:11&lt;/a&gt;; see also &lt;a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.15" class="scriptureRef"&gt;verse 15&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/opposition-in-all-things.p11" pid="fbkHFu9YRkyI39cOR8cEIw" hash="QqXhUQ"&gt;As a result, Lehi continued, “the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself. Wherefore, man could not act for himself save it should be that he was enticed by the one or the other” (&lt;a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.16" class="scriptureRef"&gt;verse 16&lt;/a&gt;). Similarly, in modern revelation the Lord declares, “It must needs be that the devil should tempt the children of men, or they could not be agents unto themselves” (&lt;a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29.39" class="scriptureRef"&gt;D&amp;amp;C 29:39&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/opposition-in-all-things.p12" pid="TLOLYH-k0EW94RWqBhBTqg" hash="mdAyjg"&gt;Opposition was necessary in the Garden of Eden. If Adam and Eve had not made the choice that introduced mortality, Lehi taught, “they would have remained in a state of innocence, … doing no good, for they knew no sin” (&lt;a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.23" class="scriptureRef"&gt;2 Nephi 2:23&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/opposition-in-all-things.p13" pid="KsUDSy95QUy7rXdp2fMszA" hash="UFZVPQ"&gt;From the beginning, agency and opposition were central to the Father’s plan and to Satan’s rebellion against it. As the Lord revealed to Moses, in the council of heaven Satan “sought to destroy the agency of man” (&lt;a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.3" class="scriptureRef"&gt;Moses 4:3&lt;/a&gt;). That destruction was inherent in the terms of Satan’s offer. He came before the Father and said, “Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor” (&lt;a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.1" class="scriptureRef"&gt;Moses 4:1&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/opposition-in-all-things.p14" pid="mwzJeVpMokOtVTeiNLPJew" hash="LZPN6w"&gt;Thus, Satan proposed to carry out the Father’s plan in a way that would prevent the accomplishment of the Father’s purpose and give Satan His glory.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/opposition-in-all-things.p15" pid="Re_9GB5jPE-n-7nVZjK2pg" hash="evURtQ"&gt;Satan’s proposal would have ensured perfect equality: it would “redeem all mankind,” that not one soul would be lost. There would be no agency or choice by anyone and, therefore, no need for opposition. There would be no test, no failure, and no success. There would be no growth to attain the purpose the Father desired for His children. The scriptures record that Satan’s opposition resulted in a “war in heaven” (&lt;a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/12.7" class="scriptureRef"&gt;Revelation 12:7&lt;/a&gt;), in which two-thirds of the children of God earned the right to experience mortal life by choosing the Father’s plan and rejecting Satan’s rebellion.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/opposition-in-all-things.p16" pid="1xDnHNeo20iQxFU7ZCUxXw" hash="KBmKeA"&gt;Satan’s purpose was to gain for himself the Father’s honor and power (see &lt;a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/14.12-15" class="scriptureRef"&gt;Isaiah 14:12–15&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.1,3" class="scriptureRef"&gt;Moses 4:1, 3&lt;/a&gt;). “Wherefore,” the Father said, “because that Satan rebelled against me, … I caused that he should be cast down” (&lt;a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.3" class="scriptureRef"&gt;Moses 4:3&lt;/a&gt;) with all the spirits who had exercised their agency to follow him (see &lt;a href="/scriptures/nt/jude/1.6" class="scriptureRef"&gt;Jude 1:6&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/12.8-9" class="scriptureRef"&gt;Revelation 12:8–9&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29.36-37" class="scriptureRef"&gt;D&amp;amp;C 29:36–37&lt;/a&gt;). Cast down as unembodied spirits in mortality, Satan and his followers tempt and seek to deceive and captivate the children of God (see &lt;a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.4" class="scriptureRef"&gt;Moses 4:4&lt;/a&gt;). So it is that the evil one, who opposed and sought to &lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;destroy&lt;/span&gt; the Father’s plan, actually &lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;facilitated &lt;/span&gt;it, because it is opposition that enables choice and it is the opportunity of making the right choices that leads to the growth that is the purpose of the Father’s plan.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/opposition-in-all-things.p18" pid="KS5CP1GozkOl2rgz6rUm2Q" hash="DirUHQ"&gt;Significantly, the temptation to sin is not the only kind of opposition in mortality. Father Lehi taught that if the Fall had not taken place, Adam and Eve “would have remained in a state of innocence, having no joy, for they knew no misery” (&lt;a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.23" class="scriptureRef"&gt;2 Nephi 2:23&lt;/a&gt;). Without the experience of opposition in mortality, “all things must needs be a compound in one,” in which there would be no happiness or misery (&lt;a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.11" class="scriptureRef"&gt;verse 11&lt;/a&gt;). Therefore, Father Lehi continued, after God had created all things, “to bring about his eternal purposes in the end of man, … it must needs be that there was an opposition; even the forbidden fruit in opposition to the tree of life; the one being sweet and the other bitter” (&lt;a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.15" class="scriptureRef"&gt;verse 15&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; His teaching on this part of the plan of salvation concludes with these words:&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/opposition-in-all-things.p19" pid="Lh1bm5HQo0KoyUtqcyIfJw" hash="RnHmJg"&gt;“Behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/opposition-in-all-things.p21" pid="3EgI-uo5ZEGAUZ2m5wFvZw" hash="tixO5Q"&gt;Opposition in the form of difficult circumstances we face in mortality is also part of the plan that furthers our growth in mortality.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;

Some of these tests are temptations to sin. Some are mortal challenges apart from personal sin. Some are very great. Some are minor. Some are continuous, and some are mere episodes. None of us is exempt. Opposition permits us to grow toward what our Heavenly Father would have us become.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/opposition-in-all-things.p24" pid="4G9tlz7khESb5u91Ci6ikw" hash="mqwINg"&gt;After Joseph Smith had completed translating the Book of Mormon, he still had to find a publisher. This was not easy. The complexity of this lengthy manuscript and the cost of printing and binding thousands of copies were intimidating. Joseph first approached E. B. Grandin, a Palmyra printer, who refused. He then sought another printer in Palmyra, who also turned him down. He traveled to Rochester, 25 miles (40 km) away, and approached the most prominent publisher in western New York, who also turned him down. Another Rochester publisher was willing, but circumstances made this alternative unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/opposition-in-all-things.p25" pid="rCVfVAilg061GFE_YQiHnw" hash="JQ9DBw"&gt;Weeks had passed, and Joseph must have been bewildered at the opposition to accomplishing his divine mandate. The Lord did not make it easy, but He did make it possible. Joseph’s fifth attempt, a second approach to the Palmyra publisher Grandin, was successful.&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/opposition-in-all-things.p26" pid="2rHtsd11-0-5Hifbb-aIJQ" hash="QbT11Q"&gt;Years later, Joseph was painfully imprisoned in Liberty Jail for many months. When he prayed for relief, the Lord told him that “all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good” (&lt;a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.7" class="scriptureRef"&gt;D&amp;amp;C 122:7&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/opposition-in-all-things.p27" pid="kucNoImgxkuuWbUufyEkPQ" hash="uWd1gg"&gt;We are all acquainted with other kinds of mortal opposition not caused by our personal sins, including illness, disability, and death. President Thomas S. Monson explained:&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/opposition-in-all-things.p28" pid="hSS7sv1uOUetPN46MAYaow" hash="C6IlrQ"&gt;“Some of you may at times have cried out in your suffering, wondering why our Heavenly Father would allow you to go through whatever trials you are facing. …&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/opposition-in-all-things.p29" pid="7FW_jITV6UOlsVAeSiHreg" hash="HqDYOQ"&gt;“Our mortal life, however, was never meant to be easy or consistently pleasant. Our Heavenly Father … knows that we learn and grow and become refined through hard challenges, heartbreaking sorrows, and difficult choices. Each one of us experiences dark days when our loved ones pass away, painful times when our health is lost, feelings of being forsaken when those we love seem to have abandoned us. These and other trials present us with the real test of our ability to endure.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/opposition-in-all-things.p30" pid="0_-8zyqGDEuCviS1hFvVPw" hash="tNxScQ"&gt;Our efforts to improve our observance of the Sabbath day pose a less stressful example of opposition. We have the Lord’s commandment to honor the Sabbath. Some of our choices may violate that commandment, but other choices in how to spend time on the Sabbath are simply a question of whether we will do what is merely good or what is better or best.&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/opposition-in-all-things.p31" pid="gmL3XwWfX0aK7nXxNzr1Ig" hash="ENz-pA"&gt;To illustrate the opposition of temptation, the Book of Mormon describes three methods the devil will use in the last days. First, he will “rage in the hearts of the children of men, and stir them up to anger against that which is good” (&lt;a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.20" class="scriptureRef"&gt;2 Nephi 28:20&lt;/a&gt;). Second, he will “pacify, and lull [members] away into carnal security,” saying “Zion prospereth, all is well” (&lt;a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.21" class="scriptureRef"&gt;verse 21&lt;/a&gt;). Third, he will tell us “there is no hell; and … I am no devil, for there is none” (&lt;a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.22" class="scriptureRef"&gt;verse 22&lt;/a&gt;), and therefore there is no right and wrong. Because of this opposition, we are warned not to be “at ease in Zion!” (&lt;a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.24" class="scriptureRef"&gt;verse 24&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/opposition-in-all-things.p32" pid="g4-aRkZ1ykqpEcUCdY-gBw" hash="InDjvA"&gt;The Church in its divine mission and we in our personal lives seem to face increasing opposition today. Perhaps as the Church grows in strength and we members grow in faith and obedience, Satan increases the strength of his opposition so we will continue to have “opposition in all things.”&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/opposition-in-all-things.p33" pid="6rM3vZ-ikU-J3eU2V8eZSw" hash="djqdVw"&gt;Some of this opposition even comes from Church members. Some who use personal reasoning or wisdom to resist prophetic direction give themselves a label borrowed from elected bodies—“the loyal opposition.” However appropriate for a democracy, there is no warrant for this concept in the government of God’s kingdom, where questions are honored but opposition is not (see &lt;a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/26.24" class="scriptureRef"&gt;Matthew 26:24&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/opposition-in-all-things.p34" pid="K5L0X2CUcEObdHJZJDTqxA" hash="4DVaiA"&gt;As another example, there are many things in our early Church history, such as what Joseph Smith did or did not do in every circumstance, that some use as a basis for opposition. To all I say, exercise faith and put reliance on the Savior’s teaching that we should “know them by their fruits” (&lt;a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/7.16" class="scriptureRef"&gt;Matthew 7:16&lt;/a&gt;). The Church is making great efforts to be transparent with the records we have, but after all we can publish, our members are sometimes left with basic questions that cannot be resolved by study. That is the Church history version of “opposition in all things.” Some things can be learned only by faith (see &lt;a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.118" class="scriptureRef"&gt;D&amp;amp;C 88:118&lt;/a&gt;). Our ultimate reliance must be on faith in the witness we have received from the Holy Ghost.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/opposition-in-all-things.p35" pid="Qx1aLxY2u0-eT2j1i-Hhsg" hash="MLGWuQ"&gt;God rarely infringes on the agency of any of His children by intervening against some for the relief of others. But He does ease the burdens of our afflictions and strengthen us to bear them, as He did for Alma’s people in the land of Helam (see &lt;a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/24.13-15" class="scriptureRef"&gt;Mosiah 24:13–15&lt;/a&gt;). He does not prevent all disasters, but He does answer our prayers to turn them aside, as He did with the uniquely powerful cyclone that threatened to prevent the dedication of the temple in Fiji;&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt; or He does blunt their effects, as He did with the terrorist bombing that took so many lives in the Brussels airport but only injured our four missionaries.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/opposition-in-all-things.p36" pid="GBrtT45eiU68bjK0U8CZGA" hash="TWurrg"&gt;Through all mortal opposition, we have God’s assurance that He will “consecrate [our] afflictions for [our] gain” (&lt;a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.2" class="scriptureRef"&gt;2 Nephi 2:2&lt;/a&gt;). We have also been taught to understand our mortal experiences and His commandments in the context of His great plan of salvation, which tells us the purpose of life and gives us the assurance of a Savior, in whose name I testify of the truth of these things. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&lt;/p&gt;

Andersen described in the morning session, Latter-day Saints are surely among those most committed to this great responsibility. We should be because we know that God loves all of His children and that in these last days He has restored vital additional knowledge and power to bless all of them. The Savior taught us to love all as our brothers and sisters, and we honor that teaching by sharing the witness and message of the restored gospel “among all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/112.1" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 112:1</a>). This is a vital part of what it means to be a Latter-day Saint. We look on this as a joyful privilege. What could be more joyful than sharing the truths of eternity with God’s children?</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/sharing-the-restored-gospel.p8" pid="fA6VeWJehESXOkPlru97zA" hash="_08l_A">Today we have many resources to share the gospel that were not available in earlier generations. We have TV, the internet, and social media channels. We have many valuable messages to introduce the restored gospel. We have the prominence of the Church in many nations. We have a greatly increased number of missionaries. But are we using all these resources to maximum effect? I believe most of us would say no. We desire to be more effective in fulfilling our divinely appointed responsibility to proclaim the restored gospel in all the world.</p>

However, because we are a worldwide Church, I wish to speak of ideas that will work everywhere, from the newest units to the most established, from cultures now receptive to the gospel of Jesus Christ to cultures and nations that are increasingly hostile to religion. I want to speak of ideas that you can share with persons who are committed believers in Jesus Christ as well as with persons who have never heard His name, with persons who are satisfied with their current lives as well as with persons who are desperately seeking to improve themselves.</p>

And His Atonement gives us the opportunity to be forgiven of our sins and, under God’s glorious plan of salvation, to qualify for eternal life, “the greatest of all the gifts of God” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/14.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 14:7</a>).

We do not believe in what the Christian world calls the doctrine of the Holy Trinity. In his First Vision, Joseph Smith saw two distinct personages, two beings, thus clarifying that the then-prevailing beliefs concerning God and the Godhead were not true.</p>

To provide that opportunity, our Heavenly Father presided over the Creation of this world, where, deprived of our memory of what preceded our mortal birth, we could prove our willingness to keep His commandments and experience and grow through the other challenges of mortal life. But in the course of that mortal experience, and as a result of the Fall of our first parents, we would suffer spiritual death by being cut off from the presence of God, be soiled by sin, and become subject to physical death.

He is the member of the Godhead who is the agent of personal revelation. As a personage of spirit (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.22" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 130:22</a>), He can dwell in us and perform the essential role of communicator between the Father and the Son and the children of God on earth. Many scriptures teach that His mission is to testify of the Father and the Son (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/15.26" class="scriptureRef">John 15:26</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/28.11" class="scriptureRef">3 Nephi 28:11</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.17" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 42:17</a>). The Savior promised that the Comforter will teach us all things, bring all things to our remembrance, and guide us into all truth (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.26" class="scriptureRef">John 14:26</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/16.13" class="scriptureRef">16:13</a>). Thus, the Holy Ghost helps us discern between truth and falsehood, guides us in our major decisions, and helps us through the challenges of mortality.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> He is also the means by which we are sanctified, that is, cleansed and purified from sin (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.17" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 31:17</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.20" class="scriptureRef">3 Nephi 27:20</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/6.4" class="scriptureRef">Moroni 6:4</a>).</p>

We know who makes it all possible, and we know what we must do to enjoy the ultimate blessings that come through God’s plan of salvation. How do we know all of this?
