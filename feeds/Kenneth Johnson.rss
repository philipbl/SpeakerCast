      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-motorcycle-ride.p2" pid="m4ZOssGVYkO4yVw-LOrqdw" hash="nMdxtg">As I collect my thoughts in this new assignment, they go to my peer group—the young men of the Church. I think back just a few years when I was sixteen years old and a printing apprentice. A fellow apprentice was totally engrossed in motorcycles. In those days we rode British motorcycles, and he had an AJS-350.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-motorcycle-ride.p3" pid="QsLCHDokR0OSKGf3ASq4ZQ" hash="E8sWpA">One sunny summer’s day, he said to me, “Would you like to come for a ride on my motorcycle?” That seemed to be a good idea. In those days we didn’t wear any protective clothing, and, thus very lightly clad, I became the passenger on his motorcycle. He weaved through the streets of Norwich and then came to a long, straight road. He leaned back and said to me, “Have you ever traveled at one hundred miles an hour?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-motorcycle-ride.p4" pid="sXjCX9RqM0S7E9fvSffZtA" hash="Ng9YDw">I said, “No.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-motorcycle-ride.p5" pid="SOM7UX8bQ06Bwk91R_8PDQ" hash="DtfvCA">He said, “Well, you’re going to.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-motorcycle-ride.p6" pid="bglN68ONeEW_TnyBTDwr4w" hash="GxKOrg">I said, “We don’t have to.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-motorcycle-ride.p7" pid="9_ueJ4RxPEe7zLlvb8-OSg" hash="9kfgCA">He began to rev the motorcycle, and the motorcycle roared forward. The skin on my face pulled tight, and the clothing blew as we went past ninety-eight to one hundred miles an hour. I determined that day that never again would I let somebody else control my life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-motorcycle-ride.p8" pid="wiuC7Z5mAUqEm3qjoxdbrQ" hash="gVmCOQ">Young men, make sure that every invitation you extend and every invitation you receive is an invitation to come unto Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-motorcycle-ride.p9" pid="J0k6v-R1CUeSmhLE-MAfLg" hash="1wI3RA">In 1959 I received that invitation. I did not even know of this, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. At a dance I met a young lady who was raised in the gospel. I was attracted to her. She said to me, “You know, I could never consider marrying you unless it were in the temple.” I responded to that invitation and was taught the gospel. She is now my eternal companion. I will ever be grateful that was the invitation she extended to me, for it has transformed my life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-motorcycle-ride.p10" pid="4FT9XNHKm0mRF01otIiByA" hash="k_IxOA">We have one child, a son. We got such a good one the first time we were not blessed with any more. And I have seen him grow through the covenants of the Lord. I walked with him through the temple. I saw him serve a mission. I look forward to July when he takes his chosen companion to the temple. The way he has lived has caused me to come unto Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-motorcycle-ride.p11" pid="0ia8oPkdLE-FFP8fJG5Dlw" hash="zazdMg">Young men, you have a great power within you to do that. Let me say to you that more sacred to me than this call, and I cannot fully express how sacred it is, are the covenants that preceded it and that will extend beyond it, for they seal to me those things most precious and sacred in my life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-motorcycle-ride.p12" pid="m0QvqoDVQkm0weO4ly8DfQ" hash="IKP19g">The British Isles are full of young men and young women who will play a significant part in the forwarding of this great work in a way that no one else could. I know that they will do this if they respond to an invitation to come unto Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-motorcycle-ride.p13" pid="PvxNKMo5K0mwGYc1vOEU6Q" hash="sfRerg">Like Jacob of old, having received my errand from the Lord, I will magnify my office unto him, taking upon me the responsibility, answering the sins of the people on my own head if I do not teach them the word of God in all diligence. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/1.17-19" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 1:17–19</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-motorcycle-ride.p14" pid="1_cdVgsnpkyXbrpGU6ysaQ" hash="cU_zvA">I know that Jesus lives, that he is the Christ, and that he leads this church. I have come to know these things because so many good people have extended to me the invitation through my life to come unto him, and this I have tried to do. I express these feelings in the sacred and holy name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

My father, like thousands of other men of his generation, was required to report for active military service. My elder brother and I were shielded from the turmoil and fear that surrounded us by a mother who compensated for the absence of our father, involving us in a variety of activities. From this I learned that when fathers are absent, mothers can be the recipients of compensatory blessings. I have fond memories of those days and recall her speaking of her beloved companion as she received letters from him, without my fully understanding who he was or what he was doing.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/we-all-have-a-father-in-whom-we-can-trust.p2" pid="NKC100c_WEGr0BiY-eVzCw" hash="6bKuSA">My first recollection of meeting my father occurred when I was five years old. A telegram was delivered to our home. My mother stood with the gold-colored envelope in her hand, making no attempt to open it. I did not realize then as I do now the reason why, and the message it could have contained. Eventually, and with great difficulty, she fumbled with the flap of the envelope. This seemed to take a long time. Even when the telegram was opened and Mother read its contents, there was no immediate response. Finally, raising the telegram high above her head, my mother joyfully exclaimed, “Dad’s coming home! Dad’s coming home!”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/we-all-have-a-father-in-whom-we-can-trust.p3" pid="WDLTpC2vdkSquri7-C1AHQ" hash="suGDAQ">My father’s parents lived in the adjoining house. Mother, holding the telegram high in the air and with a skipping step, set out in the direction of my grandparents’ home, shouting, “Dad’s coming home! Dad’s coming home!” My brother, following close behind, shouted, “Dad’s coming home! Dad’s coming home!” I brought up the rear, also shouting, “Dad’s coming home! Dad’s coming home! Who’s Dad?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/we-all-have-a-father-in-whom-we-can-trust.p4" pid="S7jx9j9VHkOePlC7dWrkFg" hash="dNgRnA">The next morning when I awoke, there was a man sitting on the edge of my bed holding a leather soccer ball from Italy. He asked if my brother and I would like to play soccer with him. Cautiously I agreed, and we went to an area of grassland near our home, where we played together. This was the beginning of my father’s continuing influence in my life. I wanted to spend every moment that I could in his company.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/we-all-have-a-father-in-whom-we-can-trust.p5" pid="bXX70tT9y0udUzaUbMphgA" hash="ddjUmA">We lived, like many others in those war-torn years, in humble circumstances. Our home was modestly furnished. Dad had many skills and used them to beautify the home. He raised the Anderson air-raid shelter located in our garden to ground level and made it his workshop. He spent many hours there repairing shoes and making items of furniture for the home. I would wander into this workshop and watch him. Just to be in his presence was a thrill for me. He invited me to help him by passing a hammer, a screwdriver, or some other tool. I was convinced that my help was necessary and that without me he would not be able to complete his task. He used a variety of pieces of wood, obtained from different sources and considered by others to be unsuitable for any practical use, and from them created items of great beauty and worth for our family. As he worked he played a game with me, inviting me to determine what he was making. I was seldom able to do so until the components were completed and the object assembled. Then I would declare with great excitement, “It’s a bookcase!” or “a table!” and wonder at his ability to create so much from so little.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/we-all-have-a-father-in-whom-we-can-trust.p6" pid="nWF90DXADkuGQgmn0XTNTQ" hash="93lNdw">As I look back and reflect upon those wonderful memories, I realize that my contribution was not necessary for my father to complete the work he was engaged in. I was the beneficiary, as through these experiences I came to know him and to love him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/we-all-have-a-father-in-whom-we-can-trust.p7" pid="rEBkntV1e0CeZoytxsKVzw" hash="QAbQ7A">How like the association we have with our Heavenly Father, believing at times that the service we engage in is for his benefit, when in reality it is comparable with my handing tools to my father. It is the relationship that develops that is of greater significance more than the contribution we make. As expressed by King Benjamin, “For how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served, and who is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart?” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.13" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 5:13</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/we-all-have-a-father-in-whom-we-can-trust.p8" pid="XFv5fr7-k0euj2tDSuWrrw" hash="aniMkQ">Just as I was not able to fully comprehend what my earthly father was building until he completed his work, so it is with our Heavenly Father. When his kingdom is established and the work is complete, we will recognize our home and shout for joy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/we-all-have-a-father-in-whom-we-can-trust.p9" pid="F9bJ2rXZykyTzpdZNtC2Ag" hash="sqNCmg">Selfless service is an essential ingredient for a full and happy life. The enlightening words of President Marion G. Romney enhance our understanding in this regard: “Service is not something we endure on this earth so we can earn the right to live in the celestial kingdom. Service is the very fiber of which an exalted life in the celestial kingdom is made” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1982, p. 93).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/we-all-have-a-father-in-whom-we-can-trust.p10" pid="N0ZSyD6SCkKAVIXTJtzEuQ" hash="qGyXWw">It is not necessary for us to know the answer to every question or comprehend the reason for every challenge we face to feel secure in the knowledge of our divine Creator. In the words of Nephi, “I know that he loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11.17" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 11:17</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/we-all-have-a-father-in-whom-we-can-trust.p11" pid="sDE7FYhiyE-x7Coc1-B02w" hash="V-rxbg">Twenty-six years after the experience with my father, I continued to learn important lessons through a father-and-son relationship. The exterior woodwork of our home was in need of redecoration. I cleaned and prepared the surface and applied an undercoat. In my mind I could visualize the flawless gloss finish that would be the product of my labors. Our five-year-old son, Kevin, watched as I prepared to apply the final gloss covering. He asked if he could help me. I hesitated before responding, considering what effect this would have on the fulfillment of my dream, or alternatively how he would feel if I declined his offer. It was almost as if I heard someone else say, “That would be a great help. Thank you.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/we-all-have-a-father-in-whom-we-can-trust.p12" pid="qAp6lcjhiEKd-oefgFc4xA" hash="Pg7TlA">Providing him with an old shirt of mine that covered him completely, almost touching the floor and with sleeves rolled back several times, we went to work on the door that secured the main entrance to our home. He was applying paint to the bottom panel as I worked on the top section. I noticed that because of his age and physical stature, he wasn’t able to spread the paint evenly and that beads of paint were resulting. Each time he bent down to recharge his brush, I would hastily smooth out the paint on the bottom panel, returning to my assigned area so that he would not realize what I was doing. After a while I decided that more important than a first-class paint job was the opportunity to work with my son. On reflection I realized how well he was doing. Thereafter, every time I approached the door and saw the distinctive style of decoration, I was reminded of what is really important in our lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/we-all-have-a-father-in-whom-we-can-trust.p13" pid="3-fPobN9k0OT3MKkDCeHJw" hash="Zk3cug">The learning experiences we shared were not restricted to a temporal plane. As we participated together in ordinances and made covenants, the power of godliness was manifest.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/we-all-have-a-father-in-whom-we-can-trust.p14" pid="5eLTjme1p0uEWU9GYW4MJQ" hash="NmtoIw">My wife, Pamela, had been raised and nurtured with the principles of the restored gospel and was able to help me appreciate the value of family prayer, family home evening, and family council.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/we-all-have-a-father-in-whom-we-can-trust.p15" pid="bkoNLiEk2US_TOBcj8q3QA" hash="gdJPQA">We determined early in our marriage that it was our responsibility to teach the gospel to our son and that Church programs would reinforce the teaching in the home. Kevin often accompanied his mother as she visited the sick and the elderly to administer compassionate service.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/we-all-have-a-father-in-whom-we-can-trust.p16" pid="INneUt_7a0yqYvQqYdqSlQ" hash="W4nxpA">These experiences have contributed to a close family relationship that has flourished through the years, giving us an insight into the potential that exists in the eternities, as described in the Doctrine and Covenants, section 130, verse 2: “And that same sociality which exists among us here will exist among us there, only it will be coupled with eternal glory, which glory we do not now enjoy.” [<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.2" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 130:2</a>]</p>

He is our Heavenly Father.</p>

I was baptized in the month of August 1959, shortly after my 19th birthday. As I ponder the events that preceded my conversion, my thoughts go back to a childhood experience.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/yielding-to-the-enticings-of-the-holy-spirit.p2" pid="ZgEmLCGHuU6s-h56YstCGA" hash="2FPV7w">Close to the home where I lived as a child was a large house. It was located on beautiful grounds enclosed by what was to me a towering fence made of wood paneling, probably six feet in height. I recall peeping through holes in the panels where knots of wood had dropped out. It was like looking through a telescope into a different world. The beautifully manicured lawns, the well-kept flower gardens, and a small orchard provided an idyllic setting for the distinctive dwelling. Unfortunately, the opportunity to enjoy the view was always brief due to the vigilant British bulldog that patrolled the gardens and was immediately attracted to anyone standing close to the exterior of the fencing. Even though the fierce dog was confined in the garden, the sound of his sniffing as he approached the fence caused me to retreat in fear as my vivid imagination conjured up a variety of possibilities.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/yielding-to-the-enticings-of-the-holy-spirit.p3" pid="ByTSO8uwCEOOHhmos2s8QQ" hash="zW1VYg">Mr. and Mrs. Lyons, who lived in the home, were schoolteachers. They had a dignified demeanor and seemed to enjoy the privacy that the house setting afforded them. To add to the intrigue, Mr. Lyons had no right hand, using instead a steel hook that protruded below the cuff of his jacket. In my boyish mind, I could imagine Mr. Lyons pursuing me, catching me by the collar with the hook, and taking me captive.</p>

So, reassured by their words, we headed for our target with all haste. Entering the grounds we climbed trees and hurriedly plucked fruit, filling our pockets and also the space between our shirts and our bodies. My heart was pounding and my pulse racing since I feared that any moment the dog or Mr. Lyons, or both, would appear in the garden and apprehend us. We ran from the scene of our trespass to a secluded place in a nearby wooded area and, after regaining our composure, began to consume the apples.</p>

In fact, they had a very bitter taste, but the tartness of these green apples did not deter us as we enthusiastically consumed our spoils, acting out of a compulsion I cannot now explain. After devouring a significant number, I contented myself with taking a bite out of each remaining apple and throwing the remnants of the fruit into the nearby bushes. The frivolity diminished as our bodies began to gradually react to the invasion they had experienced. The chemical reaction between my gastric juices and the unripe apples caused me to experience stomach cramps and to feel nauseated. As I sat regretting what I had done, I realized that a feeling within me was producing even more discomfort than the unripe apples.</p>

As I approached them, they were huddled together. I saw smoke rising in the air above them and recognized the aroma of burning tobacco. One of them had obtained a packet of cigarettes, and they were smoking. They invited me to join them, but I declined. They persisted, suggesting that my reluctance to participate was a sign of weakness. Their taunts turned to ridicule, combined with condescending remarks. But nothing they could say or do could persuade me to change my mind. I had not been raised with a knowledge of the restored gospel and knew nothing of the Word of Wisdom, but I was restrained by a feeling within that I should not participate with them.</p>
