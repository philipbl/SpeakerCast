      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/being-teachable.p1" pid="zJjb4f6UQUylMTwVHTTTjQ" hash="X5KOTA">True disciples of the Master are teachable. In just a few words, Abraham gives us much insight into why he was so greatly blessed. He lived a life “desiring to receive instructions, and to keep the commandments of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> “Desiring to receive instructions” is more than a willingness to listen. When our desire to receive instruction is a greater force than our comfort in remaining as we are, we become teachable.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/being-teachable.p2" pid="r3pYRzSj0kSHY6lK0H-dTw" hash="FJbgWw">President Brigham Young taught our “first and foremost duty [is] to seek the Lord until we open the path of communication from God to our own soul.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> Shortly after his death, the Prophet Joseph Smith appeared in a dream to Brigham Young and instructed him: “Tell the people to be humble and faithful, and be sure to keep the spirit of the Lord and it will lead them right. Be careful and not turn away the small still voice; it will teach them what to do and where to go; it will yield the fruits of the Kingdom.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/being-teachable.p3" pid="1wA3vn-b_0e72Ck2bMqHxw" hash="EGepqw">How do we ignite this power of divine instruction in our lives? First, we need to start with a willingness to be instructed. While many naturally hunger and thirst after righteousness, others may be compelled to be humble.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> Some of us, rather than follow instructions or change ourselves, would simply like to change the rules. Naaman certainly wanted to be rid of his leprous flesh but went away in a rage when told by the prophet’s messenger to simply wash seven times in the River Jordan. It was inconvenient, a little thing, and he felt that the rivers in his land were better than the Jordan. But his leprosy was cured as he listened to his servants, changed his mind, and did “according to the saying of the man of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> He was dramatically shown that there was a prophet and a God in Israel. We too must realize that God has governing laws<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> and that His wisdom is greater than our own. Even Moses observed, after seeing God’s majesty and workmanship, “Man is nothing, which thing I never had supposed.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/being-teachable.p4" pid="XmoQDDzrq0upi45k2u1r5w" hash="kFmmSw">Second, we need to put ourselves into a proper frame of mind and heart. This comes by prayerful pondering and laboring in the Spirit.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> This labor is real labor. It includes the very active steps of seeking, hearkening, and studying the scriptures. When humbled and stripped of pride, our heart is softened and now we can focus on heavenly counsel and instruction. Lamoni’s father, the powerful Lamanite king, made just that change in focus, even prostrating himself to the earth, demonstrating his great commitment to know God. He declared, “I will give away all my sins to know thee, and that I may be raised from the dead, and be saved at the last day.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/being-teachable.p5" pid="c5bXVgQWdkOacuFFgKQ3zA" hash="mV51Sw">Third, we must be obedient to the instruction we receive. Alma said, “Experiment upon my words, and exercise a particle of faith.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> Nephi simply said, “I will go and do.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> What a wonderful attitude of submission and obedience as he accepted his father’s counsel in getting the brass plates and in being told where to hunt, and the Lord’s counsel in building a ship.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> In each case he proceeded with trust, moving forward, “not knowing beforehand the things”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> that he should do or the outcome. But since we are free agents, life can sometimes be a difficult journey of applying our hearts and minds to the truths of God. Nevertheless, as President Thomas S. Monson said, “The Lord expects our thinking. He expects our action. He expects our labors.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/being-teachable.p6" pid="qlCPGI0CKkiP4T9n5pR7oA" hash="MexYkg">Becoming teachable is a process of learning line upon line. In this process we convert thoughts and feelings into actions. But what a reward for this exercise of our faith as we open the path of communication with the Lord. The Lord said, “Blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn wisdom.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span> And He also said, “Every one that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit cometh unto God, even the Father.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/being-teachable.p7" pid="t0mHnybGZ02Z2Bce4uH8yA" hash="cjGf8Q">Some years ago I remember asking my father-in-law, a seasoned bishop, about a three-by-five-inch card he always carried in his shirt pocket. His reply was that at times he felt impressions or promptings. He then liked to pull out that card and write down those feelings, whenever they came. And then he tried to act upon them as quickly as possible. It is humbling to consider that the still, small voice is always there for us, teaching us what to do and where to go. The Lord tells us that when the promptings are heeded, often more are given. If we do not follow them, the promptings eventually diminish.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/being-teachable.p8" pid="60c86881tka3DghoXdgFPw" hash="efqglw">As a result of being teachable, we gain an even greater testimony of our Heavenly Father’s care for us. We gain the security and certainty that our course in life is according to His will.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span> We even have reasons to be good, reasons to be moral, and reasons to change our behavior. By being teachable, we activate the full force and blessings of the Atonement in our lives. We become sensitive to the whisperings of the Holy Spirit so that the righteous principles taught by the prophets and the truths from the earth can place Christ deeply into our lives.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18">18</span> We become His true disciples.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/being-teachable.p9" pid="x2ALlOsHMU6K3nkv4HpdTg" hash="7yrktw">It is by loving these truths with all of our heart that an affinity develops between us and the Source of truth itself, “for intelligence cleaveth unto intelligence; wisdom receiveth wisdom; truth embraceth truth; [and] virtue loveth virtue.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span> Hence, we shall discover that the things we value and appreciate the most are those that we personally learned <span class="emphasis">from</span> the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/being-teachable.p10" pid="S-GxeY854EGQYe0O3Cwk7A" hash="87AZPg">I testify that through the Prophet Joseph Smith we have received countless revelations of truth, bearing testimony of the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Being teachable we will more clearly see, hear, and adhere to those revelations continuing even today through our living apostles, prophets, seers, and revelators. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="99"></span>As a young boy I discovered amazing power in a small flashlight. Turning it on at night, I saw a large lighted spot wherever I pointed it. My excitement increased when shining the flashlight inside a dusty barn. A cone of light was projected through the air. But the most interesting discovery came when I pressed the flashlight firmly against the palm of my hand. My entire hand glowed in the dark. The light was actually within me! To observe the physical properties of light can be exciting, but discovering the properties of spiritual light and truth is even more awe inspiring and essential.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-power-of-light-and-truth.p2" pid="v7ZvV9lxO0K4uJdivgX8PA" hash="7sD37w">We live in marvelous times, yet also an hour when peace has been taken from the earth.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> For us to prosper in these times, spiritual light must burn within us. How do we obtain this spiritual light and ensure that the truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ fill our souls? I would like to suggest three ways: (1) learn true doctrine, (2) gain pure testimony, and (3) live the gospel courageously.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-power-of-light-and-truth.p3" pid="t2X-ulIyFUWP_Fx7lRlEWA" hash="157a8Q">First, learn true doctrine. Alma discovered that “the preaching of the word had a great tendency to lead the people to do that which was just—yea, it had … more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else, which had happened unto them—therefore Alma thought it was expedient that they should try the virtue of the word of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> President Henry B. Eyring stated: “The word of God is the doctrine taught by Jesus Christ and by His prophets. Alma knew that words of doctrine had great power. They can open the minds of people to see spiritual things not visible to the natural eye. And they can open the heart to feelings of the love of God and a love for truth.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-power-of-light-and-truth.p4" pid="0okpIS04dkSSyycJHjXGYw" hash="s2YBYQ">In 1832 the Lord revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith a true and powerful doctrine about spiritual light, the Light of Christ:</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-power-of-light-and-truth.p7" pid="PVVaCPsGUkCO8LtMowNceg" hash="4-oKpA">President Boyd K. Packer reinforced this truth in saying: “The Light of Christ is also described in the scriptures as ‘the Spirit of Jesus Christ.’ … The Spirit of Christ can enlighten the inventor, the scientist, the painter, the sculptor, the composer, the performer, the architect, the author to produce great, even inspired things for the blessing and good of all mankind.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-power-of-light-and-truth.p8" pid="sLjAVez44kCw0H9_2sv00A" hash="gLb7qA">Recent scientific thinking on the fundamental properties of light is indeed stunning. Today scientists even describe light as a “carrier”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> or “messenger”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> or “mediator.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> How profound are the doctrines of the Lord!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-power-of-light-and-truth.p9" pid="5XZCeeS8Fk-L3IEXKmRPdQ" hash="BgaDjA">Second, gain pure testimony. This testimony is the confirmation by the Holy Ghost that God is our Father and Jesus is the Christ.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> The light and truth we see in all things urge us to obtain knowledge by study and by faith, which precedes the confirmation by the Spirit.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> We can learn much of God’s handiwork and goodness by our physical senses. But an even deeper testimony is revealed as we spiritually seek the truth “with real intent.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> President Spencer W. Kimball said: “The treasures of both secular and spiritual knowledge are hidden ones—but hidden from those who do not properly search and strive to find them. … Spiritual knowledge is not available merely for the asking; even prayers are not enough. It takes persistence and dedication of one’s life.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-power-of-light-and-truth.p10" pid="OOJxDyjNYUuBcAEEHvnKCg" hash="WqWaAw">Our testimonies are strengthened as we reverently observe the great universe God has created for us. The Lord declared to Enoch, “All things are created and made to bear record of me.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> Alma bore a similar testimony to Korihor, the anti-Christ: “All things denote there is a God; yea, even the earth, and all things that are upon the face of it, yea, and its motion, yea, and also all the planets which move in their regular form do witness that there is a Supreme Creator.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-power-of-light-and-truth.p11" pid="OlVJRkMG9kK6A3SzffDALg" hash="dJW-YA">The wrestle that Enos had before the Lord demonstrates the power of his father’s testimony. Enos said, “The words which I had often heard my father speak concerning eternal life, and the joy of the saints, sunk deep into my heart.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span> Elder M. Russell Ballard said: “Clear declaration of truth makes a difference in people’s lives. That is what changes hearts.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-power-of-light-and-truth.p12" pid="-gYAdIVyzU2oILexpgBptA" hash="DBnRpg">My wife and I attended a sacrament meeting near Recife, Brazil. A young boy, possibly 9 or 10 years of age, wearing his new blue suit on a very hot day, went to the pulpit and in a very relaxed way looked at the congregation. He said, “Our family has been studying about moral agency.” He then read: “Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh. … And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span> The boy then said, “Some of my older friends are choosing to smoke and use drugs, but we all will have to accept the consequences of our actions.” He finished with his testimony, saying, “I can see that this is true.” This testimony from one so young was powerful and touched our hearts deeply.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-power-of-light-and-truth.p13" pid="QqwN584LVkKzw1ugYDE1Zw" hash="ZJfaDw">Third, we must live courageously in accordance with the light and <span class="pageBreak" page-number="101"></span>testimony that we have received. We are promised, “He that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18">18</span> It takes real effort and sacrifice to live the gospel courageously. For some years temple worship for the Saints who live near Manaus, Brazil, has meant traveling two days in a crowded riverboat on the Amazon River, followed by two days’ travel in buses through the hot tropics to the Recife temple. Arriving worn out and tired, they would shower, dress appropriately, and immediately begin their temple worship. After several days of service to the Lord, they would make the long, difficult journey home. The words “but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span> were beautifully reflected by their sacrificing actions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-power-of-light-and-truth.p14" pid="-s7II7-28U-v8g1IM_Yvug" hash="LzwkcQ">To be at peace in these wonderful yet challenging times, we must learn true doctrine, gain pure testimony, and live the truths of the gospel courageously. As we live in harmony with the light and truth taught by Jesus Christ and by His prophets, we will see more clearly our eternal destiny. I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
