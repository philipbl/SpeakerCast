      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/response-to-the-call.p1" pid="PFwZ0-_Z3kCDJReHtjrSlg" hash="dygYZg">My heart is filled to overflowing. My spirit is subdued. My soul is filled with gratitude. Years ago when I was sustained as a young bishop, an impression came strongly to me that the opportunity to serve came from nothing that I had done, but that I was going to ride on a ticket that someone else had paid for. I feel that strongly today. There are many who have gone before me who have given their lives that this kingdom might be established.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/response-to-the-call.p2" pid="IyrUmUZswEO0JMEtCfyX_w" hash="AuA9ug">I am grateful for my angel mother. I am grateful for my great father and am sorry that he isn’t able to understand today this opportunity that has come to me. I am also grateful for a choice wife. When I am in her presence, I always want to be better. I’m grateful to seven lovely children, and to five lovely sons and daughters who are in-laws, and to many grandchildren. I am so grateful that they have always sustained me. Now, I’d just like to say that I’m grateful to a multitude of people—associates, the leaders of the Church (whom I’ve watched and admired and listened to for many years), also to wonderful members of the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/response-to-the-call.p3" pid="o51P0ltQF0mr3KsTNEtXEw" hash="CBHMFQ">I am also grateful to be a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. With every fiber of my being, I know that God lives. I know that he speaks. I know that he hears. I know that he loves us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/response-to-the-call.p4" pid="nfATpETVs0mBRQxWVw7zMw" hash="HU6Zsg">I am grateful for the opportunity I have had to serve in the mission field. If there were no other evidence that the church of Jesus Christ is true, what happens in the lives of young men and in the lives of wonderful new members of the Church is witness enough for me to know that this is true.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/response-to-the-call.p5" pid="2CfPrN-yVkecn2yfHi5CRQ" hash="-XT9BA">I have committed myself—recommitted myself—to the Lord, to give everything that I have. And here before you, I commit myself to do everything that I’m asked to do by these great men whom I love. Our lives have been blessed by President Kimball for thirty years. He has been a giant in our lives, and he loves us. Now I can feel your love. I can feel the love of the people, and I am so grateful for that love. As missionaries we have known what it means to have three-and-a-half million people praying for us, and I am so grateful for that.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/response-to-the-call.p6" pid="u9bc0IlccEKuRP3PDQEPjQ" hash="Jqy1dg">Now I leave you my witness that God lives and commit to you that I will do everything that I can as long as I have breath and beyond that. In the name of Jesus Christ, the Lord, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/look-to-god.p2" pid="kjtxVdwupUa0m5DCOJx6FQ" hash="rqdfXg">He is our father, the actual father of our spirits. He is the father of all men. We are His children. He knows us; He loves us. He may not like all we do, but of one thing we can be sure—He loves His children. Yes, He is a loving Heavenly Father. And He <span class="emphasis">is</span> there.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/look-to-god.p3" pid="1pr2elRoAkuz4c3NFpka0A" hash="HR11_Q">How comforting and reassuring it is each day as we behold the wonders of the universe and this beautiful world on which we live. We can see His hand in the matchless order with which the heavenly bodies move and the delicate beauty of the flowers and trees and other growing things, all of them bearing silent witness of His existence.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/look-to-god.p4" pid="CUMvgjrNEUqQWSpn2-lTdg" hash="P4Lr1g">How stimulating and edifying to approach Him in prayer each morning and evening and feel His nearness and His love as we acknowledge His hand, and in our need, seek His help. What a blessing to be able to approach the source of life and light and be strengthened and renewed by just humbly seeking and asking.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/look-to-god.p5" pid="vGAGJJek5k6STcgWN3MV-A" hash="z6EubA">Even in tragedy He is there. When traumatic challenges come and a life hangs in the balance or is hopelessly marred and the future is dark and hope grows dim and time seems long—He is there. His reassuring feeling comes through, seemingly saying, “I am here, do not worry; this will be for your good if you endure it well. Trust in me.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/look-to-god.p6" pid="lPAVWCXHXU2_x1-HgJsQXg" hash="86cmPg">As He communed with our father Abraham He told him of the purpose of sending us to earth. He said:</p>

Instead, there would be a feeling of how can I help you or what can I do for you instead of demanding my rights and my desires, which often destroys homes.</p>
