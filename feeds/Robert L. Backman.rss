    <div class="topic" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/youths-opportunity-to-serve.t1">
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/youths-opportunity-to-serve.p1" guid="d0224e5a-adee-477c-a6df-1027f30fc9f3" pid="zzrbdIYVeUSMeX-uLrrtHw" hash="hvL7xQ">My beloved brethren: Last Saturday I was honored to speak to several hundred young men and women graduating seminary students from the high schools in Utah Valley. Under the leadership of a council of their own peers, they had planned a full day’s activity, which included visits to Welfare Square and the Beehive House, a talent assembly, a devotional and testimony meeting, and a lovely dance. To my knowledge, the only adult who took active part was the area supervisor who introduced me. The rest of the adults present were there to give silent support and, by evening, were feeling their age after sharing a day of youthful vitality and enthusiastic activity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/youths-opportunity-to-serve.p2" guid="959352c4-841f-4b35-8701-3d2eae8d28cc" pid="MEFuh5M5M0SFR_eiXh3UKw" hash="G8OPFQ">I wish every adult leader in the Church could have been in attendance to share the spirit of that testimony meeting. With deep emotion, one lovely girl spoke of her reaction when it was discovered that her father had cancer. How she prayed and prayed that he be healed, then came to the realization that her prayers were selfish—that our loving Father in heaven was in control and that she should submit to his will. She evidenced a very mature outlook on life, something that some of us as adults never experience in a lifetime of living.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/youths-opportunity-to-serve.p3" guid="b2e46262-be22-4855-aaa3-d6ddb4cb46b3" pid="LSlpggtj20i86FYv9V7yoQ" hash="D_qlOA">A handsome young man, obviously a football player, told of how his testimony had been strengthened through association with fine, faithful friends, most of them a year older than he. Graduating from high school and soon to be separated from one another, they had a “last fling” together, a visit to the lovely grounds of the Provo Temple. Then they went to a quiet spot where in the late evening hours 12 future leaders of the Church bore their testimonies of the divinity of the gospel and expressed their love for one another.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/youths-opportunity-to-serve.p4" guid="99a95c2a-b35c-47a3-8d4d-3dd8299afdfd" pid="viv5w8yZwEyXxkK9cdpbTg" hash="ElaZAg">I have never heard so many expressions of love for friends and adult leaders who had influenced their lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/youths-opportunity-to-serve.p5" guid="40e6bec2-61b5-4676-941a-80cdebc98ce9" pid="LRG3ww9wo0OVpBA5CxSjzQ" hash="O0c8Eg">The meeting was closed with “I Know That My Redeemer Lives.” I have never heard those beautiful lyrics sung with more genuine feeling. Tears fell freely as those great young people sang from their hearts.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/youths-opportunity-to-serve.p6" guid="cf635cc0-a5ed-4043-a5b7-4a8d03570fe0" pid="q5CbsbCAU0aE3SEp3_6oRw" hash="Q8jeIQ">I mention their experience because it is so typical of many other experiences I have enjoyed among this royal generation of youth. As Bishop Brown has stated, there has never been a finer generation. I have great confidence that the kingdom of God will be in capable hands as they assume their future roles of leadership, and I am equally confident that they now are capable of assuming much more responsibility for their own welfare than we have been willing to give them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/youths-opportunity-to-serve.p7" guid="bfc10432-9633-4579-b7d4-6c3332b344b3" pid="wz-NiIfQ_0SVwE1vh4z9jg" hash="bAvJBw">With the new direction given to the Aaronic Priesthood MIA program, it now becomes our responsibility as adult leaders to give our youth the opportunity to grow in their capacity to lead, to serve, and to love.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/youths-opportunity-to-serve.p8" guid="083c88ae-072f-4b56-ae60-a0da21ba68bc" pid="dAgif5OpxUSOAJjpf2CNjA" hash="0qDyyw">What a challenge adult leaders have in helping youth, particularly youth leaders, to learn their duty and perform to their fullest capacity while still leaving room for their own initiative and challenge as they anxiously engage in a good cause, doing many things of their own free will.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/youths-opportunity-to-serve.p9" guid="29bd9e12-527e-4547-a5c2-563b5d132b26" pid="8DhfPO0-EUiH9PhYyj22FA" hash="7HRyKw">The Church leadership of the future will be built upon the foundation that is laid today. If youth are denied opportunities to test their own strength, then the leadership foundation will be weak and unready. Equally as serious, however, is thrusting unprepared youth leaders into situations in which they fail because the demands of that situation exceed their experience and capacity. Discouragement and doubt will result. The balance between enough responsibility and too much calls for fasting, prayer, and diligent service by youth and adult leadership as they labor together to build the kingdom. The Aaronic Priesthood MIA organization as introduced by Bishop Brown provides a setting where such a fine balance may be struck. With the bishopric of the ward—the presidency of the Aaronic Priesthood—in direct charge, the bishop’s youth committee, composed of the priests group leader, the Aaronic Priesthood quorum presidents, the girl class presidents, and the adult presidents of the Aaronic Priesthood MIA, becomes a forum where youth leaders can communicate with the bishopric. They can be totally involved in selecting their activities and be tested and taught great leadership principles without being smothered by too many adult leaders. Yet, this youth committee expands to the ward Aaronic Priesthood council with the addition of the adult leaders of the age groups, who can temper unbridled enthusiasm and zeal with their experience and practicality, exercising some degree of control without dominating the youth councils.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/youths-opportunity-to-serve.p10" guid="d30e2f5b-faa2-4965-a51c-3b58c59490fb" pid="E-7EfG0WoEqznbmgKyVFPQ" hash="qqIIEw">Bishops, an effective youth committee is vital to the success of your Aaronic Priesthood program. It may surprise you what these bright young people will come up with in the way of individual and group service projects and meaningful activities or suggestions for implementing their program.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/youths-opportunity-to-serve.p11" guid="04fc9594-6b75-40ee-8684-26a0188ee1b3" pid="f4TLQjYf_kmz15kNn65fvw" hash="Gwoofg">If you have not discovered it yet, you will. Our young men and women have a deep sense of purpose and a keen appreciation for our social needs. They want to be of service; they want to be useful; they want to make this a better world in which to live. Witness the joy of the youth who gathered by the hundreds to clean ditches and gather the debris left by the recent floods in southern Arizona, or those who cleaned up an entire Utah community in a day of service.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/youths-opportunity-to-serve.p12" guid="71ce12df-d6b4-42e2-8a7f-1fb347b2683d" pid="jpPhcJfyNEWXAOKdMO2akA" hash="rtwWsg">An active youth committee in Cache Valley made it their project to take care of the aged and shut-ins. Each week the girls would prepare suppers and the boys would prepare lessons or activities to take to the homes of the unfortunate, giving them plenty of tender loving care in a family home evening situation. What do you think that did for those young people to be involved in such a worthy, compassionate service?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/youths-opportunity-to-serve.p13" guid="dfb7d276-2840-46ea-9a8e-9d2257718924" pid="pZSR8t9bLk-CAtVn2i9seA" hash="AGO-Sw">Their deep desire to be of service and to demonstrate their love can even benefit the bishop. In Sacramento, California, while the bishop was away on vacation with his family, the youth committee determined to paint his house. These young people had the time of their lives working together and anticipating the pleasant surprise of the bishop when he returned. A real bond of love was established between the youth and their bishop with such meaningful service.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/youths-opportunity-to-serve.p14" guid="5764d6ba-b078-45ba-b676-500dd7f0fdb0" pid="xsmallLz10aB3vj0y2LYaQ" hash="mZClrA">Bishops, we urge you to make use of your youth committee; make it the effective instrument it should be to meet the needs of the youth of your ward. I hope every one of you will keep in mind the words President David O. McKay gave us so stirringly: “The spirituality of a ward will be commensurate with the activity of the youth.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/youths-opportunity-to-serve.p15" guid="80ba942e-ad1c-457d-8f82-08f6485485dc" pid="cdjbVD9AwEObK4M18hkMaw" hash="DcjX0Q">You will note, from Bishop Brown’s explanation, that each member of the bishopric has been given a particular age group—both boys and girls—to direct. What a marvelous opportunity this gives for the presidency of the Aaronic Priesthood to help our youth leaders learn the duties and responsibilities of their respective callings. And what a blessing it will be for our youth leaders to enjoy a close relationship with the great youth leaders of the ward.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/youths-opportunity-to-serve.p16" guid="dd3a4277-e433-468b-b7cc-1cd8af34a385" pid="3ObBm_2ly0WpATEiLgNbfQ" hash="qgE6_g">To you Aaronic Priesthood quorum leaders, I hope you understand that the Lord outlined your duties as presidents of the Aaronic Priesthood quorums. He directed you to preside, to sit in council with your quorum members, and to teach them their duty. He didn’t give that assignment to your advisers; he gave it to you. You share the responsibility, with the bishopric, of blessing the lives of every member of your quorum as you fulfill your sacred calling. What a transformation takes place when young Jack Smith becomes President John Smith, deacons quorum president, entitled to revelation from the Lord in directing the affairs of that quorum, and President Smith really assumes the responsibilities of his office. You are too young for such responsibility? The apostle Paul sensed something of the inadequacy young men feel when they are thrust into leadership. He counseled his young “son in the faith,” Timothy, “Let no man despise thy youth. …” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-tim/4.12" class="scriptureRef">1 Tim. 4:12</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/youths-opportunity-to-serve.p17" guid="1af109ba-9765-45a8-95ee-104ae2e5dbcb" pid="lmeSbGmdd0y2xArmp23Tsg" hash="Xxo8xg">Dana Miller was approaching his twelfth birthday, looking forward to becoming a deacon. One evening, just prior to his birthday, the front doorbell rang. Dana’s father, a high councilor in the stake, answered the door to find three young men on the porch. “We are the deacons presidency and have come to call on your son, Dana.” Admitting these quorum leaders, Brother Miller retired to another room while the presidency sat down with Dana and outlined his duties and responsibilities as a priesthood holder. That visit had more impact on a boy’s life than hours of counseling from an adult could have. Today Dana is president of the deacons quorum. What kind of a president do you think he is with that kind of an introduction to the priesthood and example from his leaders?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/youths-opportunity-to-serve.p18" guid="77d7cc27-ee33-4855-a2b0-975f7ea9da37" pid="WtMsDAwSB0a0voHPz3mVdw" hash="3wuIkw">The Lord has assured us, “For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.28" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 58:28</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/youths-opportunity-to-serve.p19" guid="d961705c-0566-4ce8-9382-811c94a35786" pid="ngRFVBQ3F0e8cCV9jiIvbw" hash="Q79l_Q">My beloved young brethren, why are we so anxious to have you assume responsibility and learn your duties as priesthood bearers? Perhaps our reason was best stated by Elder Ezra Taft Benson in a speech he delivered to an Explorer conference several years ago. He said: “We are not a church of organized sitters; we are a church of organized workers, and we want you to get into it with all your enthusiasm and power. Young men, my brethren, we want you on the field. We want you sweating it out. We want you to have responsibility because you grow under responsibility.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/youths-opportunity-to-serve.p20" guid="a57dd556-cb30-412e-b7f9-78131f8f8aea" pid="Kk6sVcbTLkKjoMZzz2FXMg" hash="4e8c3Q">You royal generation, you special people that God has reserved to come forth in this day, may God bless you with an understanding of who you are and bless you with a knowledge and understanding of the mission that he has in store for you. May your lives reflect that you are disciples of Jesus Christ, and may you, like our elder brother, grow in “wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/2.52" class="scriptureRef">Luke 2:52</a>), that you will be prepared for the awesome responsibilities that he has before you. I challenge you to do so, to honor your priesthood and to show these good brethren of ours, who are placing increased responsibility on you as bearers of the priesthood, that you are worthy of that honor.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/youths-opportunity-to-serve.p21" guid="da65b840-2c62-4a95-8f76-cdd5622399f4" pid="kHCyeB_v7UqxUxHEe5jnVg" hash="ld-huw">I bear my witness to you that God is our Father, that he loves you. He has given you the opportunity to come to this life to gain a body and to experience the joys and the sorrows of life that you can return to him and be prepared for even greater service. May God bless all of us who render service to him. May we honor our priesthood and truly represent his cause, I pray humbly in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

My angelic mother played the part of Mary, the mother of Jesus, and I had the honor of playing the role of the Christ child. I know I must have been much more comfortable at that time than I am now, probably because I didn’t have to speak. But from that day to this, my beloved brothers and sisters, I have felt the Lord’s guiding hand leading me and protecting me, sometimes protecting me from myself.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/everything-dear.p2" pid="vg7dpSQS10OKj84b0Jft8A" hash="PG2QWQ">I’ve enjoyed such rich experiences as I’ve grown up and matured. As each one has come along, I’ve questioned, “Why me? Why has the Lord given me such rich opportunities to grow and to develop? Why has he provided such opportunities to give service?” I thank him from the bottom of my heart for the richness of my life, the happiness which I’ve enjoyed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/everything-dear.p3" pid="Hwu2IIDIHEW7NF0Ct-2-mw" hash="F55M1A">All of my life it seems that I’ve been surrounded by people who have built me and caused me to be better than myself, again, who sometimes have protected me from myself: my noble parents, who from the cradle have taught me the priorities that I ought to have in my life as they have sought the Lord first and foremost in their lives; a lovely, faithful wife who has sustained me in every calling I’ve received; seven beautiful daughters who think I ought to be the president of the Church; their wonderful husbands who are faithful and true to the covenants they have made in the house of the Lord; and delightful little grandchildren who are the joy of my life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/everything-dear.p4" pid="HtXwzuCs3kqr5fi0VA2LRw" hash="WoQdBg">President Benson, in our seminar last Friday, mentioned the fact that the highest honor we could have is to be members of God’s church, which I am; to know that Christ is our Savior, our personal Savior, which I testify to you I know; to hold his holy priesthood, which I do; and to be a part of an eternal family unit, which I am. I’m honored above all men. I’m blessed above all men. And I’m so grateful for this holy calling which has come to me.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/everything-dear.p5" pid="eCCRPyhLQUmmeXsIaT0vog" hash="nImToQ">I want to say to each one of you, my beloved brothers and sisters, that every blessing I have in my life, everything I hold dear and precious in my heart, I can trace to my membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, to my love of the Lord, to the testimony I have of his divine gospel, and to the responses I’ve made to the opportunities of service.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/everything-dear.p6" pid="2DT8f6Cp1Uyn7fkMkhg-rg" hash="4sdhSw">I rejoice now for the opportunity of concentrating my entire life to his service, and without reservation I lay my life and everything I have at his feet. President Kimball and my beloved brethren, my dear wife and I are prepared to go wherever you want to send us and do whatever you ask of us, and pray only that we might be instruments in the hands of the Lord to assist you dear brethren in your awesome assignment to build the kingdom of God; to sanctify his people; and to prepare the way when Christ will come in all of his glory and will take the reins of government, and Satan will be bound, and every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that he is the Savior of the world, and he will reign forever and ever, which I testify in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

That was a signal honor for a grandfather, and I know Robbie couldn’t have been more proud of it than I was. Since that time, I have considered very much what I would like to say to Robbie concerning this honor that has come into his life and how desirous I am as his grandfather that he live worthy of what was promised him in the blessing that his father gave him under the inspiration of the Lord. So tonight I would like to address my remarks to Robbie and to all this grand army of Aaronic Priesthood who sit here in front of me and are listening throughout the world.</p>

That was always a great experience, but it sometimes gave me insights into the backgrounds of my missionaries that shocked me. One elder told me of his growing up in a small farming community as the son of the town drunkard. When, as a newly called missionary, he boarded the bus to come to Salt Lake City to enter the mission home, his father was there to bid him farewell. He must have been drunk, for his last words to his son were, “Son, you will never amount to a hill of beans.”</p>

I resolved to prove that father wrong by seeing that the missionary had a successful mission. I assigned him to a great first companion and watched his progress with keen interest and daily prayers. And progress he did.</p>

By this time the young man was a zone leader, a very important calling in the mission field. He conducted that zone conference like a veteran bishop. I saw the deep bond of love that had developed between him and his missionaries. I thought of the scores of converts who had joined the Church through his devoted service and the power of his testimony. At an appropriate moment in the conference I stood beside him with my arm around him and said, with a lump in my throat, “You wouldn’t believe this, but someone once said of this young man that he would never amount to a hill of beans.” He turned and looked me in the eye and responded, “We sure showed him, didn’t we, President?”</p>

He had made some interesting discoveries that had prepared him to face the challenge of life and to be armed to succeed—the same discoveries every young Latter-day Saint must make as he matures if he is to achieve his potential here and hereafter. He had discovered that he really was a son of God—with the capacity to become as God is, with all of his power, his might, and his majesty. He knew the truth of Christ’s oath: “All that my Father hath shall be given unto him” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.38" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:38</a>). What a discovery for a young man to make—that he is a son of God!</p>

During that party the young missionary showed his friends <span class="emphasis">Man’s Search for Happiness,</span> explained why he was going on a mission for his church, and bore his testimony to them.

He is schooling you for your important missions and he expects you to recognize that you are different from other boys and young men—not better, but different—because you have been blessed with the gospel of Jesus Christ and the priesthood of God. Because he has given you so much, he expects you to live beyond your friends and associates who do not have the light of the gospel—he expects you to be in the world but not of the world.

In Africa, the natives have a unique, effective way to capture monkeys. They lop the top off a coconut, remove the meat, and leave a hole in the top of the coconut large enough for the monkey to put his paw in. Then they anchor the coconut to the ground with some peanuts in it. When the natives leave, the monkeys, smelling those delicious peanuts, approach the coconuts, see the peanuts in them, put their paws in to grasp the nuts, and attempt to remove the nuts—but find that the hole is too small for their doubled-up fists. The natives return with gunny sacks and pick up the monkeys—clawing, biting, screaming—but they won’t drop the peanuts to save their lives.</p>

During his tenure, the stake president asked a boy and a girl from each ward to visit with him about their relationship with their bishop. During the conversation, the stake president asked, “If you had a serious problem in your life, would you take it to your bishop?” Most responded that they wouldn’t. And when he asked why, their response surprised him. They said, “Our bishop seems too righteous.” To the credit of my friend, his youth replied: “Not our bishop.”</p>

Our Church handbooks request that each quorum have a weekly activity on a day other than Sunday. At least once a month a combined activity with the Young Women should be held. When these directions are followed, good habits are formed; but when activities are held sporadically or “as needed,” the continuity essential for the success of the program is missing. Plan them well in advance, at least three months in advance, but preferably a year in advance. Careful calendaring and adequate planning will allow time to do things well and will be attractive to our youth.</p>

Becoming a man is more than chronological. It involves proving the young man’s manhood, testing his mettle, challenging the world, demonstrating he can accomplish more than he thought he was capable of. That’s what builds character and manliness.</p>

As our young men grow up, they tell us that team sports are the most popular activity in the Church. That doesn’t mean unsupervised basketball on activity night. The sports program can be as broad as the interests of the young men: basketball, softball, volleyball, soccer, wrestling, boxing, cycling, swimming, tiddledywinks. Through sports we can appeal to the most inactive young men and, at the same time, build a spirit of brotherhood as quorum members learn to compete as a team.</p>

Today he teaches drama in a great university and is a faithful member of the Church. How easily we could have lost him without that opportunity to be someone and to excel at something. Our cultural arts have been neglected in recent years, not intentionally, but when stakes and wards were given the liberty to choose their activities instead of being dictated to from Church headquarters—something made necessary by the worldwide growth of the Church—some took this as a signal that cultural arts were no longer to be promoted. The ward and stake activity committees are there to help our bishoprics, quorums, and Young Women classes carry out those cultural activities planned by the Bishopric Youth Committee: music, drama, speech, dance. These again are as broad as the interests of the youth and a valuable resource in promoting activity and brotherhood in the Aaronic Priesthood quorums.</p>

Too often we only entertain, leaving our young men in the role of spectators. They will grow as they are involved, and they will develop love for their fellowmen, at the same time forgetting their own weaknesses and frailties as they serve. The sooner our young men have experiences in meaningful service, the sooner they will understand their priesthood responsibilities and their own capacity to truly be their brother’s keeper, and the sooner they will discover the key to lasting happiness. In service every quorum member will know that he is needed. Even the most inactive will respond to an invitation to bless someone’s life.</p>

Our presiding brethren have instructed us to be very careful how we spend the Saints’ money. We who deal with the youth recognize that a good portion of stake and ward budgets, and much of the out-of-pocket Church expenses of our families, are related to youth activities such as athletics, Scouting, dances, plays, and youth conferences.

If we do, we will be making a sad mistake. As President Gordon B. Hinckley spoke on the subject in general conference, he said: “We do not mean to be parsimonious.

Even a high adventure does not need to be an exotic, expensive trip. High adventures can be had close to home when well planned. Youth conferences need not be held in faraway places to serve their purposes. And what’s wrong in letting our young men earn their money for Scouting, athletics, and other programs? They will learn some valuable lessons about the realities of life as they do.</p>

May God help all of us to give the time, attention, and tender, loving care we need to give, to prepare these noble young men for the rich adventures and the singular missions that lie ahead of them, I pray in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

But then a miracle happened. As she took the stage, she said, “I can’t accept this award. Yes, I have loved the teams and cheered for them at every game. But Fern has come to every game, too. I came in a nice, warm car surrounded by my happy friends. She came alone and walked all the way—two and a half miles—sometimes in the rain or snow.

Such people have a way of becoming important to us because we know we are genuinely important to them.

Charity for those outside of our circle of friends is difficult to comprehend when we feel so comfortable within the confines of our ‘group.’ But if we look at the life of our Savior, we see that He didn’t leave His ‘group,’ the Apostles, or those friends about Him. He merely opened His arms to all who would listen. He increased His fold. So … we do not have to leave our group to learn to care for the feelings of our peers. We just need to open our arms and increase our friendships.”</p>

As a 17-year-old high school senior, Ronny had never really had a close friend or done anything that included other people. He was famous for his shyness. He never said anything to anybody, not even a teacher. One look at him told you a great deal of the story—inferiority complex. He slumped over as if to hide his face and seemed to be always looking at his feet. He always sat in the back of the class and would never participate. …</p>

Class was obviously painful for Ronny, but Brandon protected him like the king’s guard. I played a low profile—no questions, just a quick smile and once a pat on the back. Time seemed to be helping, but I often wondered if Brandon and company (the rest of the class certainly played it right) would ever be able to break the ice. That’s why I was so shocked when Brian, the class president, stood before our Sunday School class one Sunday afternoon and boldly announced that Ronny would offer the opening prayer.</p>

We watched with anticipation and excitement as he prepared for that great adventure. We saw a transformation take place as he experienced his farewell, his temple endowment, and his entrance into the Missionary Training Center. It was a literal miracle to see a typical selfish teenage boy become a selfless servant of God. He became a man overnight. We thrilled at his letters from the Training Center in which he told his friends to get with it—that “this” is where it’s at. We saw a new boldness as he became immersed in his mission. That boldness and spirit have been increased now that he is in the mission field teaching what he believes.</p>

Let me tell you something about commitment. You have just got to make it. Get committed! Read the Book of Mormon. I did it in nine days, and I only read for one and a half hours a day. Get committed to attend church every week. It is a commandment of God, and it’s necessary for baptism. Get committed to pray. If you would read the Book of Mormon and pray about it, you would know that it is true. Finally, get committed to baptism. Christ did it, and you have to, too. I suspect that you know the gospel is true, or you wouldn’t put up with it. Remember, God knows you know it; and if you don’t make the commitment, he will still hold you accountable because you know the truth.

        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/the-golden-years.p12" pid="BAR1Wod9KUiLBBIAYEHkUQ" hash="LvIx8A">One of the dangers I see in retiring is that we withdraw from the world. We turn inward as society seems to say, “We have no more use for you.” With the aging of our society, more and more of us are going to retire. I hope the Church will continue to use us. We have been tried and tested throughout our lives. Society is not likely to experience any challenge we have not faced. We have learned what is important and what brings lasting happiness. Use our experience, our testimonies, our wisdom, and our understanding. We can still assist in building the kingdom of God. I believe he needs all the help he can get.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/the-golden-years.p13" pid="-_O4RD-sZEyjxyeLkrBJpg" hash="fzQKfQ">There is no retirement from the service of the Lord. We believe in eternal progression. We should continually grow spiritually throughout our lives. The gospel challenges us to endure to the end.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/the-golden-years.p14" pid="zcBQdwZ2qUeYmhA7gp-ACA" hash="zFB2mg">The word <span class="emphasis">endure</span> has an interesting connotation. We seem to equate it with suffering. I was interested to discover that <span class="emphasis">endure</span> comes from the Latin word <span class="emphasis">indurare,</span> which means “to harden, to steel, make lasting.” I like one of the definitions of the word <span class="emphasis">endure</span> found in the <span class="emphasis">Random House Dictionary.</span> It defines <span class="emphasis">endure</span> as “to have or gain continued or lasting acknowledgment or recognition, as of worth, merit, or greatness.”</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/the-golden-years.p15" pid="RxlKceZunUeggi1stR9cpA" hash="VLmqTg">When I think of the supernal joy I have experienced during my ministry, I hope those rich spiritual adventures are not ended. I know they will not be if I accept the opportunities to serve that lie ahead.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/the-golden-years.p16" pid="dEF3BUuaF0Swl6NmcDVcZw" hash="tL9dLg">Having been deeply involved in missionary work for the past several years, I see such glorious opportunities for older couples to continue to be useful in serving their fellowmen. How badly the Church needs us!</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/the-golden-years.p17" pid="-5SGGwjBt02H2jRKPTBYhg" hash="PMLQcQ">There are so many of you who have found fulfillment in serving missions, forgetting yourselves in that important work, staying youthful in the discipline and single-mindedness that come with being immersed in the gospel and sharing your testimonies with all those you meet. I hope I can do the same!</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/the-golden-years.p18" pid="AYihOvfaPk-qUaepLAFc3A" hash="5CGCVg">I think of Royce Flandro and his wife, who after retirement served a mission in Spain, performing valuable service. Upon returning home, they missed that beautiful experience, so they came to the Missionary Department to ask where they could help the most. It was suggested to them that they might learn Hungarian, which they did. A few months later they were called to Hungary, once again serving with distinction. Now they are headed for Mongolia.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/the-golden-years.p19" pid="IMn-mgF7EEOwfLN5Tlzk1w" hash="CQOluQ">So many of us are afraid to leave our “comfort zones” and thus cheat ourselves of some of the greatest adventures of our lives.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/the-golden-years.p20" pid="7WJT_CVKPU-fYAmmzB58iA" hash="__gTBg">Brother and Sister Harold Salway have served in Fiji, Ireland, South Africa, Israel, England, California, and are now preparing to go to Florida. They intend to continue to serve as long as their health permits. Who can measure the good they have done or the blessings they have received?</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/the-golden-years.p21" pid="yN_s1Zw0sUuoaXay4MyxlQ" hash="pQUWRw">The staff in the Missionary Department recently received a letter from President Thomas R. Murray of the Missouri Independence Mission concerning the missionary service of Elder and Sister Ronald Smith. He wrote:</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/the-golden-years.p22" pid="HWigLQk2IkO21ruV6sb9ww" hash="FtxCYA">“The Smiths left a legacy in Nebraska City, Nebraska. They baptized eighteen people, reactivated a large number in two wards, traveled many miles per month, contributed to the local newspaper, gave meaningful community service, motivated the Scouting program, strengthened the ward leadership, fellowshipped and friendshipped, and provided great public relations for the Church in the community.”</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/the-golden-years.p23" pid="GE9MUXH2PU2POdPnltUo_Q" hash="uaiWrQ">Where could the Smiths have spent a more productive, profitable time or experienced more fulfilling service?</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/the-golden-years.p24" pid="aAy82gg-oES72CUIGiGQHA" hash="w81s6g">Some have an idea that as we get older we can’t learn languages. That is not true. Again and again, we see couples come to the Missionary Training Center without prior knowledge of a language and leave two months later able to communicate. Of course their skills increase as they love and serve in the mission field. Even when a new language is difficult, older couples perform a unique service in the missions simply by being there. Their experience, example, and faith serve as tremendous resources in building inexperienced members of the Church. They are absolutely indispensable to the growth of the kingdom across the world.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/the-golden-years.p25" pid="ODr_niUqUk6GZXJeV6RPmQ" hash="uEEcAA">I remember meeting a wonderful couple who were missionaries among the Southeast Asians of the California Oakland Mission. As I saw the bonding between the missionaries and these delightful new Latter-day Saints, I asked the sister missionary whether she could speak their language. She responded that she could not. I then asked her how they communicated with the members. With tears in her eyes, she replied, “We just love them.”</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/the-golden-years.p26" pid="MpE-An3ohUaIpThu2rsAtA" hash="EMZ68g">I have rejoiced in the rich experiences of the past fourteen years, but I look forward to the challenges of the golden years ahead. I look forward to new experiences, new adventures, new horizons, new worlds to conquer. I look forward to new opportunities to grow physically, mentally, socially, and spiritually. I pray that my life, from this day forth, will testify that I am a disciple of Jesus Christ, the Son of God!</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/the-golden-years.p27" pid="qAnKWI5lf0qWVhpBwC6dvA" hash="oQiFDw">I pray that you and I might wear ourselves out in the service of the Lord so that at the end of our useful, productive lives we can exult with Paul: “I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-tim/4.7-8" class="scriptureRef">2 Tim. 4:7–8</a>.)</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/the-golden-years.p28" pid="LmMEr6xbaUaSWG0vqDgJbA" hash="9WXC-w">I conclude my public ministry by paraphrasing the words I spoke in 1978, words that have even deeper meaning for me after that choice experience.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/the-golden-years.p29" pid="NaZqQaH88kG67M9TdGw7lQ" hash="G3FbyQ">President Benson declared that the highest honor we could have is to be members of God’s church, which I am; to know that Christ is our Savior, which, I testify to you, I know; to hold his holy priesthood, which I do; and to be part of an eternal family unit, which I am. (See <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 1978, p. 72.) I’m honored above all men. I’m blessed above all men. And I am so grateful for the holy calling which I have enjoyed. I rejoice in the opportunity that has been mine of consecrating my entire life to his service.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/the-golden-years.p30" pid="oDBsBH1pfkGUk3IcY18qcA" hash="pqkY3A">Every blessing I have in my life, everything I hold dear and precious in my heart, I can trace to my membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, to my love of the Lord, to my testimony of his divine gospel, and to the responses I have made to the opportunities for service.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/the-golden-years.p31" pid="z5zRqKGI-0-mCuB1KOeilA" hash="SHFKJw">My beloved Brethren, my dear wife and I are still prepared to go wherever you want to send us and to do whatever you ask of us, and pray only that we might be instruments in the hands of the Lord to assist you in your awesome assignment to build the kingdom of God, to sanctify his people, and to prepare the way for Christ to come in his glory when every knee will bow and every tongue confess that he is the Savior of the world, which I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. (See Conference Report, Apr. 1978, p. 109; or <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 1978, p. 72.)</p>
