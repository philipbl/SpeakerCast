      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/happiness-is-homemade.p1" pid="v5HZs3wWL0OxN3_Jx6DNKg" hash="DmqZOA">A month ago we experienced an important event in our lives. Our oldest grandchild was married for time and eternity in the Salt Lake Temple. As that beautiful young lady knelt in the temple with a fine young man, many hopes and blessings were realized—for that young couple, the realization of the tremendous blessings of the temple ordinances; and for their parents, the fulfillment of years of teaching and loving. My wife, Patricia, and I felt many blessings as that group assembled, which included our eight children and their spouses.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/happiness-is-homemade.p2" pid="mCXevqJ6Mk60EjaaYlVOZQ" hash="Bn1rag">Since that day, we have reminisced and reviewed many teachings about what we see as the ideal home and family—which home and family, as to location, size, and makeup, are as diversified as our members. But these factors do not lessen the desire each of us has to achieve that ideal. President David O. McKay said, “It is possible to make home a bit of heaven; indeed, I picture heaven to be a continuation of the ideal home.” (<span class="emphasis">Improvement Era,</span> Oct. 1948, p. 618.) We hope that our children experience some of the following things in our home.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/happiness-is-homemade.p3" pid="yCuWdUyRnUiZ3itsYDUSNQ" hash="DWTOXA">Perhaps the best gift parents can give their children is to love each other, to enjoy each other, and even to hold hands and demonstrate their love by the manner in which they talk to each other.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/happiness-is-homemade.p4" pid="x8wRBLiv40WKbo7wvRIwgg" hash="v7EkPg">Home should be a happy place because all work to keep it that way. It is said that happiness is homemade, and we should endeavor to make our homes happy and pleasant places for us and our children. A happy home is one centered around the teachings of the gospel. This takes constant, careful effort by all concerned.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/happiness-is-homemade.p5" pid="nVYl61J9N0ClTPd03dQZ3w" hash="Eec15g">In the ideal home, each child would be given every possible opportunity to develop his own personality without too much domination. Discipline is organized love, and children develop properly in an atmosphere of love, with adequate guidelines to shape their lives and their habits. More children are punished for mimicking their parents than ever for disobeying them. We should <span class="emphasis">be</span> what we want to <span class="emphasis">see.</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/happiness-is-homemade.p6" pid="gEfEWbg2fUSkQ6noccjwVQ" hash="V4pIDQ">We find in Doctrine and Covenants 88:119 [<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.119" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:119</a>] the verse that describes the kind of homes we should strive to create: “Organize yourselves; prepare every needful thing; and establish a house, even a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/happiness-is-homemade.p7" pid="6TodK7SNWESPKUepYB_WEA" hash="2vZ5EQ">We know that the world is flooded with books and magazines of negative value for us and for our children. The books in our homes are to be read, and there should be no shelves under lock and key because they hold books of questionable content.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/happiness-is-homemade.p8" pid="a-pVh1q7u0q0IpeuXRwvBQ" hash="r9RTNA">Absolute truth should abide in our homes, and we should sincerely try to answer any question in honesty. Honesty is the companion of truth, and dishonesty of falsehood. We should expect complete honesty from our children as well as from us as parents.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/happiness-is-homemade.p9" pid="qEqtrPCEz0qmSD99-2571g" hash="jlswGg">In our homes, we should exhibit hospitality, and friends should feel welcome. In our home, we preferred that our children search our refrigerator and use our kitchen rather than search the many dark places in the world. Ice cream is better bought early than wished-for later.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/happiness-is-homemade.p10" pid="CkMmObKzxky7CmEQgy-H-Q" hash="WJeU1A">In the ideal home, Sunday would be the happiest day of the week. We should look forward to its coming because it is the day we go to church together and then come home and discuss together what we learned in our various church meetings. Around the kitchen table at dinnertime would be an excellent opportunity to have both parents and children tell about what they learned in their Sunday School classes and other meetings. How we observe the Sabbath indicates our feelings toward our Father in Heaven.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/happiness-is-homemade.p11" pid="UPndQNcM3EWAlGwcETAkdA" hash="Ne0p_g">Although Father and Mother work hard, they should find time to keep informed on current events and to read good books, to discuss the <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> the <span class="emphasis">New Era,</span> and the <span class="emphasis">Friend</span> with each other and with their children. These magazines can add a wonderful dimension to our lives if we make them part of our homes and discuss them with our families. This is an ongoing challenge for all of us, but it is worth the effort.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/happiness-is-homemade.p12" pid="4hVCSsotFE2PrTjIj-mCMQ" hash="0FJWAQ">The family should kneel together daily in family prayer. <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/58.10" class="scriptureRef">Alma 58:10</a> tells us: “Therefore we did pour out our souls in prayer to God, that he would strengthen us and deliver us out of the hands of our enemies, yea, and also give us strength that we might retain our cities, and our lands, and our possessions, for the support of our people.” Our family has always needed to be strengthened—and still does—and kneeling in prayer daily certainly helps. Children need to be constantly taught how they should act when they mature and have their own families.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/happiness-is-homemade.p13" pid="12XE1qeaw0ejrqvDUETXmQ" hash="eyxyDg">Mothers and daughters should be ladies and be modest in all ways. Mothers and daughters should be active in Relief Society, Young Women, or Primary. Sister Curtis and I often reminisce about attending Relief Society at the side of our mothers when we were children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/happiness-is-homemade.p14" pid="b-PZWGVl-EqzdddnSwYGSw" hash="-q5gLg">Fathers and sons should act gentlemanly and kind. They should honor their priesthood, fill missions, and serve the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/happiness-is-homemade.p15" pid="bSRu99y5ZUu0_SrLUsuQuA" hash="mDNR8w">Families need to observe the Word of Wisdom in all ways, never compromising the dos and don’ts of this sacred commandment.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/happiness-is-homemade.p16" pid="DeajGVZrsESwsvkgHMgUAA" hash="QIYXog">Mothers and fathers and children need the experience of bearing their testimonies and expressing their love for our Father in Heaven and Jesus Christ. Testimony-bearing is not restricted to the chapel. The family room can be the ideal setting for some very sensitive spiritual experiences. Happy memories are made by appointment, and parents need to plan special spiritual events to create spiritual memories in their homes.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/happiness-is-homemade.p17" pid="hF3Vm8TwU0i-zh3Zt_7z3Q" hash="UkvciQ">Parents need to care enough to wait up for the children as they return from their dates, or go and find them if they are out too late. I remember reading many pages of scriptures as I sat at the kitchen table waiting for the teenagers to return.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/happiness-is-homemade.p18" pid="86AvOpnvA0SZkiHmkW9TLQ" hash="OteRTg">The kitchen table can provide a place for many valuable lessons and warm communications. We should not only partake of good food, but of love and friendship. Scriptures could be read around the kitchen table, and mothers and fathers could explain the teachings of the prophets. Nephi said, “For my soul delighteth in the scriptures, and my heart pondereth them, and writeth them for the learning and the profit of my children.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4.15" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 4:15</a>.) As we reflect on our years of rearing children, we can see how we and our loved ones have always needed the scriptures. What better could we discuss with our children than the scriptures and our love for them?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/happiness-is-homemade.p19" pid="e6I5HVQvD0etEQ98qWy8Aw" hash="rdxNHg">Children need to know that their parents love them enough to teach them the gospel. Monday evenings can be made special by family home evening—by the love present, and by music, games, and valuable learning moments. We have found that the child who is rolling on the floor during family home evening listens and learns more than we think possible.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/happiness-is-homemade.p20" pid="fCKGMRpM2EKq7IYWmujHUQ" hash="EkcXtQ">As parents, Sister Curtis and I now watch as our eight children have their own homes. We ponder deeply as we watch them teach their children, who are our grandchildren, about the principles of the gospel. We know it’s not easy, but we also know that we all must try.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/happiness-is-homemade.p21" pid="R8YqCS41k02uMfPRAs2pUQ" hash="LWQkVg">The things I have talked about today are some of the ideals, some of the things that all of us may work toward. Very few of us have reached that point, but President McKay said it is possible, and knowing that certainly makes the trying worthwhile.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/happiness-is-homemade.p22" pid="bsrwvXSAtkmZBSuWyObKSw" hash="yAlVNA">I testify that I know the gospel of Jesus Christ and all that it gives us is meant for our happiness and for the happiness of those we love. Jesus Christ is the center of our lives. I know that he is close to his servants on this earth this day. He loves each of us, and we can honestly sing and proclaim, “I am a child of God” and mean it. (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> 1985, no. 301.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/happiness-is-homemade.p23" pid="EjXWVG_DMUm8nyBwH0zKkg" hash="W5_1PA">I testify that Jesus is the Christ. I love him; my wife loves him; and we deeply desire that our children and grandchildren will love and obey our Lord and Savior. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

Elder Marion G. Romney has told us that “at the heart of society’s fatal sickness is the instability of the family.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> We recognize that some homes are large, graciously appointed, even luxurious. Others are very small and humble, with scant furnishings. Yet each and every “home can be a heav’n on earth when we are filled with love, … Where we want to be” (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> 1985, no. 298), as one of our beloved hymns reminds us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/a-table-encircled-with-love.p2" pid="DFc5StZSY0aO6_KlPYygHg" hash="fsPS2w">One of the more important furnishings found in most homes is the kitchen table. Now it may be small, it may be large, or in the form of a little counter with barely room to put the food and utensils. Its major function seems to be a place for the different members of the family to receive nourishment.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/a-table-encircled-with-love.p3" pid="HMTPD_AxhE2rPoroSaGNIA" hash="HWag1A">On this special occasion, my desire is to bring your attention to a deeper, more important function for the kitchen table, where we can receive much more than nourishment for our physical well-being.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/a-table-encircled-with-love.p4" pid="1JXgeb6jAU6hPNasxhG8HQ" hash="aJThfA">A family generally has two or more members of differing ages, but the family needs to meet—preferably not only just to eat, but to pray, to talk, to listen, to relate, to learn, to grow together. President Gordon B. Hinckley has stated it so well: “My plea—and I wish I were more eloquent in voicing it—is a plea to save the children. Too many of them walk with pain and fear, in loneliness and despair. Children need sunlight. They need happiness. They need love and nurture. They need kindness and refreshment and affection. Every home, regardless of the cost of the house, can provide an environment of love which will be an environment of salvation.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/a-table-encircled-with-love.p5" pid="-0vg2fs7FESDikzGmF2BUw" hash="ht8PVw">Most family members are subjected to the many forces of the world outside of the home, as well as the powerful influence of radio, television, videos, tapes, and many other things which we bring into our homes.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/a-table-encircled-with-love.p6" pid="MEGh0a0c8U-f9-X9n5_Ebw" hash="J7_fhg">Picture a family gathering around a table, perhaps the kitchen table, talking about the gospel, talking about the sacrament meetings, the messages, talking about the current <span class="emphasis">Ensign</span> or the current <span class="emphasis">New Era,</span> talking about school with all of its ramifications, talking about general conference, talking about the Sunday School lessons, listening to good music, talking about Jesus Christ and his teachings. The list could be expanded. Not only parents, but all family members would be wise to make certain that each person present has a chance to talk and ample opportunity to participate.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/a-table-encircled-with-love.p7" pid="VqWhdublpUqbXaxBc6ysiQ" hash="6qskdw">Think of the potential of a family kneeling around a table (without television), praying, pleading for help, thanking our Father for blessings—teaching all ages the importance of a loving Father in Heaven. Family prayer with little ones may well develop older ones who someday will pray with their families.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/a-table-encircled-with-love.p8" pid="ztVzVT95lkChkevn2yxriw" hash="QXEusw">President Thomas S. Monson stated it well: “The Lord directed that we have family prayer when he said: ‘Pray in your families unto the Father, always in my name, that your wives and your children may be blessed’ (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18.21" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 18:21</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/a-table-encircled-with-love.p9" pid="9WODd7qj6kaMxtIPeRhV2A" hash="mQldUQ">“Will you join me as we look in on a typical Latter-day Saint family offering prayers unto the Lord? Father, mother, and each of the children kneel, bow their heads, and close their eyes. A sweet spirit of love, unity, and peace fills the home. As a father hears his tiny son pray unto God that his dad will do the right things and be obedient to the Lord’s bidding, do you think that such a father would find it difficult to honor the prayer of his precious son? As a teenage daughter hears her sweet mother plead unto the Lord that her daughter will be inspired in the selection of her companions, that she will prepare herself for a temple marriage, don’t you believe that such a daughter will seek to honor this humble, pleading petition of her mother whom she so dearly loves? When father, mother, and each of the children earnestly pray that these fine sons in the family will live worthy that they may in due time receive a call to serve as ambassadors of the Lord in the mission fields of the Church, don’t we begin to see how such sons grow to young manhood with an overwhelming desire to serve as missionaries?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/a-table-encircled-with-love.p10" pid="wYGOYuzUMkOUWbzPcvZJXg" hash="BZSEVA">As many have said, “How could you possibly send your parents and your children out into the world each day without gathering together and talking to the Lord?” Wise parents will examine their schedules and plan at least one time daily to gather the family for the blessings of prayer. Very soon, young members learn how to take their turn and learn the precious values found in family prayer.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/a-table-encircled-with-love.p11" pid="a3yaNFTsiUGjHnGb49I_3g" hash="ZcBdlA">I have stated before that “home should be a happy place because all work to keep it that way. It is said that happiness is homemade, and we should endeavor to make our homes happy and pleasant places for us and our children. A happy home is one centered around the teachings of the gospel, and this takes constant, careful effort by all concerned.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

As the wise mother was praying the next day, she intentionally left that youngster out of the prayer. As the prayer concluded, the busy child said, “Mother, you left me out of the prayer!” The loving mother explained that she was just responding to the youngster’s complaint. The busy child complained, “Don’t leave me out.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/a-table-encircled-with-love.p13" pid="MdR4MMJN0EGvmmapEyyPDw" hash="DrlLDQ">Visualize a family surrounding a table with the scriptures open, discussing the many truths and lessons to absorb. This indeed is a table encircled with love!</p>

We can bless our children by reading the scriptures with them on a daily basis—at the kitchen table.</p>

Our major success is simply trying—over and over.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/a-table-encircled-with-love.p16" pid="n-ZlcaaqKEOGGzpM3Kk22g" hash="pnIFpw">There are many forces in the world today seeking to decimate the family and the home. Wise parents will strive to strengthen family ties, increase spirituality in the home, and focus on Jesus Christ and temple activity. President Hunter has told us:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/a-table-encircled-with-love.p17" pid="VR7ye4roNk-joKg0FflzsQ" hash="MAO0kg">“I pray that we might treat each other with more kindness, more courtesy, more humility and patience and forgiveness.</p>

It would be the deepest desire of my heart to have every member of the Church temple worthy.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/a-table-encircled-with-love.p19" pid="AUbvGj-Gq0OAy971vXxxzw" hash="Q7G0LQ">The direction given by President Hunter can be markedly enhanced by what takes place around the kitchen table.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/a-table-encircled-with-love.p20" pid="Age_6iR_hkqqRBMPB1WBrw" hash="cKQ_NQ">In our homes, we should practice how to treat others. As Goethe said so well, “If you treat [an individual] as he is he will stay as he is, but if you treat him as if he were what he [could] be and [might] be, he will become what he ought to be.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>

Packer stated: “To bring some of the things of heaven into the home is to insure that family members will graduate to church participation. The family home evening is, of course, ready-made for this—a meeting at home that can be organized to fit every need; and it’s just as much a church meeting, or can be, as those held at the chapel.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> This counsel also agrees with what Elder Dean L. Larsen has told us: “Our church buildings are not the only places where we can worship. Our homes should also be places of devotion. It would be well if each day we could ‘go home to church.’ There should be no other place where the Spirit of the Lord is more welcome and more easily accessible than in our own homes.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>

Lee: “Remember that the most important of the Lord’s work that you [and I] will ever do will be … within the walls of [our] own home.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>

In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
