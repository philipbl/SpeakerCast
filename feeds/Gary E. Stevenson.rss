        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="101"></span>What a wonderful conference it has been. How blessed we are to hear the counsel of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve, whom we sustain as prophets, seers, and revelators.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/sacred-homes-sacred-temples.p2" pid="wGa4QwN3bE-mnl05YnyNmQ" hash="frheUw">I remember a warm, sunny afternoon when spring was trying to nudge its way through a long winter in Cache Valley, Utah. My father, whose Saturdays were always filled with chores for his grandsons, stopped by our home with an offer to “go for a ride.” Always happy to ride in Grandpa’s truck, our four- and six-year-old sons scurried into the back jump seat, and I joined my father in the front. Our drive took us through the streets of downtown Logan, which wrap around the Logan Temple, prominently situated on a hill, centered beautifully in the city. As we moved further away from the city, we turned from paved, busy streets to seldom-used dirt roads, where we crossed old bridges and weaved through trees far into the country. We were far from any other traffic and all alone.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/sacred-homes-sacred-temples.p3" pid="oDSJVbEvI0-zwtUdBAQG5w" hash="TJB9GQ">Realizing his grandsons were in a place they had not been before, my father stopped the truck. “Do you think we are lost?” he asked the wide-eyed boys as they gazed out the windshield across the valley. Followed by a moment of silent assessment came the profound reply of a young child. “Look,” he said, pointing his finger. “Grandpa, you are never lost when you can see the temple.” Our eyes turned, focusing with his, seeing the sun glistening off the spires of the Logan Temple, far across the valley.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/sacred-homes-sacred-temples.p4" pid="901o1CoNwUSCOIrszYOETA" hash="fOtHmg">You are never lost when you can see the temple. The temple will provide direction for you and your family in a world filled with chaos. It is an eternal guidepost which will help you from getting lost in the “mist of darkness.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> It is the house of the Lord.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> It is a place where covenants are made and eternal ordinances are performed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/sacred-homes-sacred-temples.p5" pid="0YOeuOLO906ayIsCoMJNkQ" hash="tAtX5A">In the Book of Mormon, King Benjamin directed the Saints of his time and place to gather, “every man having his tent with the door thereof towards the temple.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> As Church members, we have recently received counsel from modern-day prophets which, if followed, will turn the doors of our homes more fully towards the temple.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/sacred-homes-sacred-temples.p6" pid="MJu7_kQqlkWngohno19n4g" hash="ApBfdw">The First Presidency has invited “adult members to have a current temple recommend and visit the temple more often” where time and circumstance permit and encouraged members “to replace some leisure activities with temple service.” They also encouraged “newer members and youth of the Church who are 12 years of age and older to live worthy to assist in this great work by serving as proxies for baptisms and confirmations.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> Even our young children have been encouraged to visit the temple grounds and touch the temple.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> President Thomas S. Monson once counseled, “As we touch the temple, the temple will touch us.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/sacred-homes-sacred-temples.p7" pid="7F8kNLr2R0GaK3DKmX_Z-A" hash="9SR4QQ">We are blessed to live in a temple-building dispensation in which 146 temples have been dedicated or announced.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> Under the definition of “Temple” in the Bible Dictionary, we read the following: “It is the most holy of any place of worship on the earth,” followed by this insightful statement: “Only the home can compare with the temple in sacredness.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> For me this suggests a sacred relationship between the temple and the home. Not only can we turn the doors of our homes to the temple, or the house of the Lord; we can make our homes a “house of the Lord.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/sacred-homes-sacred-temples.p8" pid="I3s3L64VgU66Yo1HTok84A" hash="okDu9g">Recently, in a stake conference, all present were invited by the visiting authority, Elder Glen Jenson, an Area Seventy, to take a virtual tour of their homes using their spiritual eyes. I would like to invite each of you to do this also. Wherever your home may be and whatever its configuration, the <span class="pageBreak" page-number="102"></span>application of eternal gospel principles within its walls is universal. Let’s begin. Imagine that you are opening your front door and walking inside your home. What do you see, and how do you feel? Is it a place of love, peace, and refuge from the world, as is the temple? Is it clean and orderly? As you walk through the rooms of your home, do you see uplifting images which include appropriate pictures of the temple and the Savior? Is your bedroom or sleeping area a place for personal prayer? Is your gathering area or kitchen a place where food is prepared and enjoyed together, allowing uplifting conversation and family time? Are scriptures found in a room where the family can study, pray, and learn together? Can you find your personal gospel study space? Does the music you hear or the entertainment you see, online or otherwise, offend the Spirit? Is the conversation uplifting and without contention? That concludes our tour. Perhaps you, as I, found a few spots that need some “home improvement”—hopefully not an “extreme home makeover.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/sacred-homes-sacred-temples.p9" pid="ymAgeJP45E-q5QAQiUZcvQ" hash="_sjslg">Whether our living space is large or small, humble or extravagant, there is a place for each of these gospel priorities in each of our homes.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/sacred-homes-sacred-temples.p10" pid="H11MSc6VnkuEC62_gpuwWQ" hash="OHPeZA">In order to keep the temple and those who attend it sacred and worthy, the Lord has established standards through His servants, the prophets. We may be well-advised to consider together, in family council, standards for our homes to keep them sacred and to allow them to be a “house of the Lord.” The admonition to “establish … a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> provides divine insight into the type of home the Lord would have us build. Doing such begins the construction of a “spiritual mansion” in which we all may reside regardless of our worldly circumstance—a home filled with treasure that “neither moth nor rust doth corrupt.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/sacred-homes-sacred-temples.p11" pid="HKMAqZPW1USvKkEFhcmG3w" hash="wKeEyg">There exists a righteous unity between the temple and the home. Understanding the eternal nature of the temple will draw you to your family; understanding the eternal nature of the family will draw you to the temple. President Howard W. Hunter stated, “In the ordinances of the temple, the foundations of the eternal family are sealed in place.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/sacred-homes-sacred-temples.p12" pid="b_Al79O74UGMCG7xUznROg" hash="Opu0pA">President Boyd K. Packer counseled: “Say the word <span class="emphasis">temple.</span> Say it quietly and reverently. Say it over and over again. <span class="emphasis">Temple. Temple. Temple.</span> Add the word <span class="emphasis">holy. Holy Temple.</span> Say it as though it were capitalized, no matter where it appears in the sentence.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/sacred-homes-sacred-temples.p13" pid="edHrmUIx3U-__iSNKHh1tA" hash="fEuRpQ">“Temple. One other word is equal in importance to a Latter-day Saint. <span class="emphasis">Home.</span> Put the words <span class="emphasis">holy temple</span> and <span class="emphasis">home </span>together, and you have described the house of the Lord!”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span></p>

They sang of desire, promises, and preparation. The things of which they sang begin in sacred homes and continue in sacred temples. I think you will hear the tune in your hearts as I read the words:</p>

      <span class="pageBreak" page-number="51"></span>Tonight I feel especially blessed to speak as a bishop to the young men, holders of the Aaronic Priesthood, gathered from around the world for this general priesthood meeting. I share with you narrative from the Book of Mormon describing Helaman and his 2,000 stripling soldiers. This scripture will provide insight into the character of those ancient young men—and inspiration for you, latter-day young men. I quote a favorite scripture: “And they were all young men, and they were exceedingly valiant for courage, and also for strength and activity; but behold, this was not all—they were men who were true at all times.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> Courage, strength, activity, and truth—what admirable traits!</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/be-valiant-in-courage-strength-and-activity.p6" pid="l4vSKlxL3k6mvcjLTd2Ujw" hash="52zZvA">I would like to focus on the first trait that describes them: “valiant for courage.” To me, this describes the conviction of these young men to courageously do what is right, or as Alma describes, “to stand as witnesses of God at all times … and in all places.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> The 2,000 stripling soldiers had countless moments to demonstrate their courage. Each of you will also have defining moments in your life requiring courage. A friend of mine, John, shared with me one of those moments in his life.</p>
    <span class="story">
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/be-valiant-in-courage-strength-and-activity.p7" pid="4pg-TlztN0ycbiOhbTyrOQ" hash="5u1qUg">Some years ago, John was accepted at a prestigious Japanese university. He would be part of the international student program with many other top students from around the world. Some enrolled with a hope to deepen their understanding of the culture and language, others viewed it as a stepping-stone to an eventual profession and employment in Japan, but all had left home to study in a foreign country.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/be-valiant-in-courage-strength-and-activity.p8" pid="gCdKNsjN0UazPsaUV7euhA" hash="xkvA9g">Soon after John’s arrival, word of a party to be held on the rooftop of a private residence spread among the foreign student population. That evening, John and two friends made their way to the advertised address.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/be-valiant-in-courage-strength-and-activity.p9" pid="TJdC_d7wjEmi60z6eqEZow" hash="LbGvAg">Following an elevator ride to the top floor of the building, John and his friends navigated the single narrow stairway leading to the rooftop and began mingling with the others. As the night wore on, the atmosphere changed. The noise, music volume, and alcohol amplified, as did John’s uneasiness. Then suddenly someone began organizing the students into a large circle with the intent of sharing marijuana cigarettes. John grimaced and quickly informed his two friends that it was time to leave. Almost in ridicule, one of them replied, “John, this is easy—we’ll just stand in the circle, and when it is our turn, we’ll just pass it along rather than smoke it. That way we won’t have to embarrass ourselves in front of everyone by leaving.” This sounded easy to John, but it did not sound right. He knew he had to announce his intention and act. In a moment he mustered his courage and told them that they could do as they wished, but he was leaving. One friend decided to stay and joined the circle; the other reluctantly followed John down the stairs to board the elevator. Much to their surprise, when the elevator doors opened, Japanese police officers poured out and hurried to ascend the stairs to the rooftop. John and his friend boarded the elevator and departed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/be-valiant-in-courage-strength-and-activity.p10" pid="WaNr7y6z40yg1hoXQxf9Aw" hash="FhhDcA">When the police appeared at the top of the stairs, the students quickly threw the illegal drugs off the roof so they wouldn’t be caught. After securing the stairway, however, the officers lined up everyone on the roof and asked each student to extend both hands. The officers then walked down the line, carefully smelling each student’s thumbs and index fingers. All who had held the marijuana, whether they had smoked it or not, were presumed guilty, and there were huge consequences. Almost without exception, the students who had remained on the rooftop were expelled from their respective universities, and those convicted of a crime were likely deported from Japan. Dreams of an education, years of preparation, and the possibility of future employment in Japan were dashed in a moment.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/be-valiant-in-courage-strength-and-activity.p11" pid="CBXXb8Bes0ilWx5nOWKX7g" hash="X-kOTA">Now let me tell you what happened to these three friends. The friend who <span class="pageBreak" page-number="52"></span>stayed on the roof was expelled from the university in Japan to which he had worked so hard to be accepted and was required to return home. The friend who left the party that night with John finished school in Japan and went on to earn degrees from two top-tier universities in the United States. His career took him back to Asia, where he has enjoyed immense professional success. He remains grateful to this day for John’s courageous example. As for John, the consequences in his life have been immeasurable. His time in Japan that year led him to a happy marriage and the subsequent birth of two sons. He has been a very successful businessman and recently became a professor at a Japanese university. Imagine how different his life would have been had he not had the courage to leave the party on that important evening in Japan.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/be-valiant-in-courage-strength-and-activity.p12" pid="MSLY_wtTkEaB7cBsEdtA4g" hash="UloDeA">Young men, there will be times when you, like John, will have to demonstrate your righteous courage in plain view of your peers, the consequence of which may be ridicule and embarrassment. Additionally, in your world, skirmishes with the adversary will also be fought on a silent, solitary battlefield in front of a screen. Technology with its substantial benefits also brings challenges not faced by generations before you. A recent national survey found that today’s teens are tempted at alarming levels each day not only in schools but also in cyberspace. It revealed that teens who were exposed to images of drinking or drug use on social networking sites were three to four times more likely to use alcohol or drugs. Commenting on the survey, a former U.S. cabinet secretary stated: “This year’s survey reveals a new kind of potent peer pressure—digital peer pressure. Digital peer pressure moves beyond a child’s friends and the kids they hang out with.

One young man on the football team, or the campus, or among his fellow workers can, by living the gospel, honoring his priesthood, and taking a stand for the right, do untold good. Often you will experience much criticism and ridicule even by those who believe as you do, even though they may respect you for doing right. But remember that the Savior himself was tormented, ridiculed, spat upon, and finally crucified because he would not waver in his conviction. Have you ever stopped to think what would have happened had he weakened and said, ‘Oh, what’s the use?’ and abandoned his mission? Do we want to be quitters, <span class="pageBreak" page-number="53"></span>or do we want to be valiant servants in spite of all the opposition and evil in the world?

			<span class="pageBreak" page-number="84"></span>The recent Olympic Winter Games enthralled the world as athletes representing 89 countries competed in 98 different events. Remarkably, 10 of these athletes were members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 3 of whom earned medals recently highlighted in the <span class="emphasis">Church News:</span> Christopher Fogt, Noelle Pikus-Pace, and Torah Bright.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> We offer our congratulations to all of the athletes who competed. Well done!</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/your-four-minutes.p6" pid="hHrsxzFyl0-cVwN34vd0tQ" hash="VxHNQQ">I speak of these games this morning directing my thoughts to young men, young women, and young single adults—you who are in your critical years which set the course for your life. I feel a great sense of urgency in addressing you.</p>
		<span class="story">
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/your-four-minutes.p7" pid="UHsDLmf9f0CUTlb8pFkWCQ" hash="6ssnKA">For you to feel that urgency, I first share the story of Noelle Pikus-Pace, one of those Latter-day Saint athletes. In Noelle’s event, the skeleton, athletes build momentum as they sprint and then plunge headfirst on a small sled. With their faces inches above the ground, they race down a winding, icy track at speeds that top 90 miles (145 km) an hour.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/your-four-minutes.p8" pid="ymnw_ZNc3UCNKrmA80MYbQ" hash="c92Ygw">Remarkably, years of preparation would be considered either a success or a disappointment based on what happened in the space of four intense 60-second runs.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/your-four-minutes.p9" pid="K9HuhI1CnUuQad9ORxND0g" hash="9Lp8jw">Noelle’s previous 2006 Olympic dreams were dashed when a terrible accident left her with a broken leg. In the 2010 Olympics her dreams fell short again when just over one-tenth of a second kept her from the medal stand.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span>
			</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/your-four-minutes.p10" pid="rS1M9_Lmqkapx8LhKbM6cQ" hash="6a6Cdw">Can you imagine the anxiety she felt as she waited to begin her first run in the 2014 Olympics? Years of preparation would culminate in only a sliver of time. Four minutes total. She spent years preparing for those four minutes and would spend a lifetime afterward reflecting on them.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/your-four-minutes.p11" pid="K19WHZ8iLEy00mOnIMPoPA" hash="_UbjjQ">Noelle’s final runs were virtually flawless! We will never forget her leap into the stands to embrace her family after crossing the finish line, exclaiming, “We did it!” Years of preparation had paid off. We saw her Young Women medallion around her neck as the silver medal was placed there beside it.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span>
			</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/your-four-minutes.p12" pid="Eu7-HA7M2UCKxVIBRYmTFQ" hash="d7J3NA">It may seem unfair that Noelle’s entire Olympic dreams hinged on what she did during just four brief minutes. But she knew it, and that is why she prepared so diligently. She sensed the magnitude, the urgency of her four minutes, and what they would mean for the rest of her life.</p>
		</span>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/your-four-minutes.p13" pid="8VMGZUqUCEaP3-ArTZFroQ" hash="eItIJA">We also remember Christopher Fogt, a member of the team that won the bronze medal in the four-man bobsled race. While he could have given up after a devastating crash in the 2010 Olympics, he chose to persevere. After a fantastic, redemptive run, he won the prize he so diligently sought.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span>
		</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/your-four-minutes.p14" pid="IpAcFT_1a0GBwtFAS7hVOA" hash="nhqKAA">Now, consider how your pathway to eternal life is similar to these athletes’ “four-minute performance.” You are an eternal being. Before you were born, you existed as a spirit. In the presence of a loving Heavenly Father, you trained and prepared to come to earth for a brief moment and, well, perform. This life is your four minutes. While you are here, your actions will determine whether you win the prize of eternal life. The prophet Amulek described, “This life is the time … to prepare to meet God; yea, behold the day of this life is the day … to perform [your] labors.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span>

		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/your-four-minutes.p15" pid="ve2Ycd_ghU28PZJgjC92Cg" hash="H_0VSg">In a sense, your four minutes have already begun. The clock is ticking. <span class="pageBreak" page-number="85"></span>The words of the Apostle Paul seem so fitting: to run the race, that you may obtain the prize.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span>

		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/your-four-minutes.p16" pid="jIAUJ8EdcEOG-cPxDkFM0g" hash="RQ9cbQ">In the same way that certain steps are essential in the very brief performance of an Olympic athlete—jumps or maneuvers for ice skaters and snowboarders, negotiating the turns of a bobsled run, or carving through the gates of a downhill slalom course—so it is in our lives, where certain things are absolutely essential—checkpoints which move us through our spiritual performance on earth. These spiritual markers are the essential God-given ordinances of the gospel: baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, priesthood ordinations, temple ordinances, and partaking of the sacrament each week.</p>

Whatever it may be, do it now. Don’t wait. Your four minutes will pass quickly, and you’ll have eternity to think about what you did in this life.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span>

		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/your-four-minutes.p21" pid="fCwyRM8x8Uqe2hUCKbX_DA" hash="lYtIng">Self-discipline is needed. Daily prayer, scripture study, and church attendance must be the foundation of your training. A consistent pattern of obeying the commandments, keeping the covenants you have made, and following the Lord’s standard found in <span class="emphasis">For the Strength of Youth</span> is required.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/your-four-minutes.p22" pid="aPBQso0ftU-aedywKq9nvA" hash="_zf_mA">Perhaps you’re aware of things in your life that are threatening to slow or stop your spiritual progress. If so, follow this scriptural counsel: “Let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span>
		</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/your-four-minutes.p23" pid="A1Aoas5w1EyCdUHnGmvIkQ" hash="6YAmxA">It is not yet too late to repent. But it soon may be, because no one really knows when your four minutes will be over.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/your-four-minutes.p24" pid="Zp2bFygCpkWyDtPf6CLOng" hash="AIZUZA">Now, you may be thinking to yourself, “I already blew it. My four minutes are already a disaster. I may as well give up.” If so, stop thinking that, and never think it again. The miracle of the Atonement can make up for imperfections in our performance. As Elder Jeffrey R. Holland has taught:</p>

			<span class="pageBreak" page-number="86"></span>Although my remarks have been directed to the youth of the Church, for parents and grandparents, I offer the following:</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/your-four-minutes.p29" pid="JXWe97By_kSmeh5cqFCesw" hash="kFt6kA">Recently, Elder David A. Bednar described a simple way to conduct a family assessment to mark progress on the covenant path by essential ordinances. All that is needed is a piece of paper with two columns: “name” and “plan for next or needful ordinance.” I did this recently, listing each family member. Among them, I noted an infant grandson, soon to be blessed; a six-year-old grandson, whose preparation for baptism was essential; and a son turning 18, whose preparation for the priesthood and temple endowment was imminent. Everyone on the list needed the sacrament ordinance. This simple exercise assisted Lesa and me in fulfilling our role to help each member of our family along the covenant path, with an action plan for each of them. Perhaps this is an idea for you which will lead to family discussions, family home evening lessons, preparation, and even invitations for essential ordinances in your family.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/your-four-minutes.p30" pid="mtIdDadulkGez9pRZWYYRw" hash="kpXa1w">As a skier and a snowboarder myself, I was deeply impressed with the “four-minute” silver medal-winning performance of Australian LDS athlete and snowboarder Torah Bright in the half-pipe competition. She dazzled the world as she finished a virtually flawless run culminating in a backside rodeo 720. However, even more impressive and surprising to the world was the way she reached out and demonstrated Christlike love to her competitors. She noticed that American snowboarder Kelly Clark, who had a bad first run in her final round, appeared to be nervous about her second run. “She gave me a hug,” Clark recalls. “She just held me until I actually calmed down enough and I slowed my breathing. It was good to have a hug from a friend.” Kelly Clark would later join Torah on the winners’ podium as a bronze medalist.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/your-four-minutes.p31" pid="jDDjUlOMqUWetDHMbL-LyQ" hash="qyy9Cg">When asked about this unusual act of kindness toward her opponent, which could have put her own silver medal at risk, Torah simply said, “I am a competitor—I want to do my best—but I want my fellow competitors to do their best, too.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span>
			</p>
		</span>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/your-four-minutes.p32" pid="D2QagIGIZ0SBIPAUMvrvBQ" hash="QLpLEg">With that in mind, is there someone who needs your encouragement? a family member? a friend? a classmate or fellow quorum member? How can you help them with their four minutes?</p>

In some ways, you are racing down the half-pipe or sled track, and it can be challenging to perform each element or navigate each turn along the way.

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/plain-and-precious-truths.p5" pid="ppJGFGbXl06opWfaKeKcFg" hash="ticHVw">Dear brothers and sisters, it has been many decades since a general conference has been convened that President Boyd K. Packer and Elders L. Tom Perry and Richard G. Scott were not seated immediately behind the podium and speaking at one of these sessions. Our memories of them are poignant, and I add my tribute to honor them, each so uniquely different yet so harmonized in their witness and testimony of Jesus Christ and His Atonement.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/plain-and-precious-truths.p6" pid="TxP6NWdciEaErGC3CiGc4Q" hash="pXA-NQ">Furthermore, I, like you, find strength in and sustain President Thomas S. Monson as prophet, seer, and revelator, and I marvel at his faithful and dutiful apostolic service spanning over 50 remarkable years.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/plain-and-precious-truths.p7" pid="C9sJYNL9SUu_wncWzxjgpw" hash="SFU4JQ">And so it was on Tuesday morning of this week, just after 9:00 a.m. as the Bishopric was beginning a meeting with the Asia Area Presidency, who are here for conference, that I was called to meet with President Monson, along with his counselors. Moments later, as I walked into the boardroom adjacent to his office, I must have looked nervous sitting across the table, as he kindly spoke to calm my nerves. He commented, noting my age, that I seemed quite young and even looked younger than my age.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/plain-and-precious-truths.p8" pid="V7Uuwc514EWUONI9DZAV8Q" hash="FvHW-Q">Then, within a few moments, President Monson described that acting on the will of the Lord, he was extending a call to the Quorum of the Twelve to me. He asked me if I would accept this call, to which, following what I am sure was a very undignified audible gasp, in complete shock, I responded affirmatively. And then, before I could even verbalize a tsunami of indescribable emotion, most of which were feelings of inadequacy, President Monson kindly reached out to me, describing how he was called many years ago as an Apostle by President David O. McKay, at which time he too felt inadequate. He calmly instructed me, “Bishop Stevenson, the Lord will qualify those whom He calls.” These soothing words of a prophet have been a source of peace, a calm in a storm of painful self-examination and tender feelings in the ensuing agonizing hours which have passed day and night since then.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/plain-and-precious-truths.p9" pid="aq_nIiYGRU2P2OB8xjiIFw" hash="8-Ugfw">I rehearsed what I have just described to you to my sweet companion, Lesa, later that day, seated in a quiet corner on Temple Square, with a serene view of the temple and the historic Tabernacle lying before us. As we tried to comprehend and process the events of the day, we found our anchor to be our faith in Jesus Christ and our knowledge of the great plan of happiness. This leads to an expression of my deepest love for Lesa. She is the sunshine in and of my life and a remarkable daughter of God. Hers is a life punctuated by selfless service and unconditional love of all. I will strive to remain worthy of the blessing of our eternal union.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/plain-and-precious-truths.p10" pid="STAYp2O4SEOJbXAVZ7NplA" hash="kpa8jw">I express my deepest love to our four sons and their families, three of whom are here with their beautiful wives, the mothers of our six grandchildren; the fourth, a missionary, has special permission to stay up past missionary curfew and is viewing these proceedings live with his mission president and the mission president’s wife from their mission home in Taiwan. I love each of them and love how they love the Savior and the gospel.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/plain-and-precious-truths.p11" pid="lW02-DwLUUiLhKtkGY6p0A" hash="yqpovA">I express my love to each member of my family: to my dear mother and to my father, who passed away last year, who instilled in me a testimony which seemed to dwell in me from my earliest memories. I further extend this gratitude to my brother, sisters, and their faithful spouses, as well as Lesa’s family, many of whom are actually here today. I cast this net of gratitude to numerous extended family, friends, missionaries, leaders, and teachers along the way.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/plain-and-precious-truths.p12" pid="hI5Aa8p36EuLlTnMnatHyg" hash="cwGB4w">I have been blessed with a close association with the members of the First Presidency, the Twelve, the Seventy, and the general auxiliary presidencies. I express my love and esteem to each of you sisters and brothers and will strive to be worthy of our continued association. The Presiding Bishopric enjoys an almost heavenly unity. I will miss my association each day with Bishop Gérald Caussé, Bishop Dean M. Davies, and the staff.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/plain-and-precious-truths.p13" pid="-dOWHOOepkuFwdigJDIYGQ" hash="4uhCHg">I stand before you as evidence of the words of the Lord recorded in the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants: “That the fulness of [the] gospel might be proclaimed by the weak and the simple unto the ends of the [earth], and before kings and rulers.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> These words are preceded by the Lord’s declaration which demonstrates the love of a Father for His children: “Wherefore, I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come upon the inhabitants of the earth, called upon my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and spake unto him from heaven, and gave him commandments.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/plain-and-precious-truths.p14" pid="zJ6zvayCuECxCMorbh-YnA" hash="A5M5Ag">Our loving Heavenly Father and His Son, Jehovah, with a knowledge of the end from the beginning,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> opened the heavens and a new dispensation to offset the calamities that They knew would come. The Apostle Paul described the forthcoming calamities as “perilous times.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> For me, this suggests that Heavenly Father’s generous compensation for living in perilous times is that we also live in the fulness of times.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/plain-and-precious-truths.p15" pid="8dZnzUxExUSFbijt-EuGHw" hash="cXOLww">As I agonized over my inadequacies this week, I received a distinct impression which both chastened and comforted me: to focus not on what I can’t do but rather on what I can do. I can testify of the plain and precious truths of the gospel.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/plain-and-precious-truths.p16" pid="Ae7eT6BdUk6sZdKspXOHOQ" hash="_QiJsQ">These are the words which I have shared hundreds of times with both those who belong to the Church and many who are not members: “God is our [loving] Heavenly Father. We are His children. … He weeps with us when we suffer and rejoices when we do what is right. He wants to communicate with us, and we can communicate with Him through sincere prayer. …</p>

There in our comfortable cars, heaters would soon warm cold fingers and toes. The sound of the frozen snow crunching with each step we took confirmed that this was extreme cold.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/where-are-the-keys-and-authority-of-the-priesthood.p6" pid="kl9VSs6jFEu6HZ0CvmWmkQ" hash="pMOECA"&gt;Our family had enjoyed a fun-filled day on the ski slopes, which was now coming to a frosty close. Arriving at the car, I reached in my coat pocket for the keys and then another pocket and another. “Where are the keys?” Everyone was anxiously waiting on the keys! The car battery was charged, and all the systems—including the heater—were ready to go, but without the keys, locked doors would deny entrance; without the keys, the engine would not provide power to the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/where-are-the-keys-and-authority-of-the-priesthood.p7" pid="HbYzK5Msuk2CBJeCqHaFjw" hash="aJcKeg"&gt;At the time, our primary focus was on how we were going to get into the car and get warm, but I couldn’t help but think—even then—there just might be a lesson here. Without keys, this wonderful miracle of engineering was little more than plastic and metal. Even though the car had great potential, without keys, it could not perform its intended function.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/where-are-the-keys-and-authority-of-the-priesthood.p8" pid="Alkp5gNWO0utI-AQxYNwDQ" hash="3ihu7A"&gt;The more I reflect on this experience, the more profound this analogy has become to me. I marvel at Heavenly Father’s love for His children. I stand in wonder at the heavenly visitation and the grand visions of eternity God bestowed upon Joseph Smith. And in particular, my heart is filled with overwhelming gratitude for the restoration of priesthood authority and priesthood keys. Without this restoration, we would be locked out from the vehicle necessary to transport us on our journey home to loving heavenly parents. The performance of every ordinance of salvation comprising our covenant pathway back to the presence of our Father in Heaven requires appropriate governance through priesthood keys.&lt;/p&gt;

Soon thereafter, Peter, James, and John conferred upon them the Melchizedek Priesthood keys.&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In the same way that our family was locked out of the car, resulting from lost car keys, so too had all of Heavenly Father’s children been locked out from the saving ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ—until a divine restoration was effected by these heavenly messengers. Never, ever again do we have to question, “Where are the keys?”&lt;/p&gt;

Nelson in September of last year. There, I felt the power and reality of the heavenly events which took place on that sacred ground. That experience led me to ponder, study, and pray about priesthood authority and priesthood keys, which impressed me with a desire to share with the young men and young women of the Church how priesthood authority and restored keys can bless them.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/where-are-the-keys-and-authority-of-the-priesthood.p13" pid="W9wK4gTEkkO_Ct5uJtuQqQ" hash="TEtyxw"&gt;First, an understanding of these terms may be helpful. The priesthood, or priesthood authority, has been defined as “the power and authority of God”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; and “the consummate power on this earth.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; Priesthood keys are defined for our understanding as well: “Priesthood keys are the authority God has given to priesthood leaders to direct, control, and govern the use of His priesthood on earth.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt; Priesthood keys control the exercise of priesthood authority. Ordinances that create a record in the Church require keys and cannot be done without authorization. Elder Dallin H. Oaks taught that “ultimately, all keys of the priesthood are held by the Lord Jesus Christ, whose priesthood it is. He is the one who determines what keys are delegated to mortals and how those keys will be used.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Consider the full-time missionary force of approximately 75,000 laboring in the field under the direction of these keys. With this in mind, remember it is never too early for you to prepare for missionary service. In &lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;For the Strength of Youth,&lt;/span&gt; we read, “Young men of the Aaronic Priesthood, … work diligently to prepare yourself to represent the Lord as a missionary.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt; Young women can prepare also, but you “are not under the same mandate to serve.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt; All of your preparation, however, whether you serve as a full-time missionary or not, will accrue lifelong benefits to you as a member missionary.&lt;/p&gt;

Ordinances performed in these temples enable individuals and families to return to the presence of our heavenly parents.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/where-are-the-keys-and-authority-of-the-priesthood.p19" pid="qIPm4WFzbUuz-mTfhNT81w" hash="iDRD2Q"&gt;We encourage you young men and young women to research and find the names of your ancestors and perform proxy baptisms for them in the temple. We note that this is already taking place in significant and unprecedented numbers throughout the world! Baptistries in many temples are filled with young men and young women early in the morning and into the night. Keys are turned that allow families to be bound together as sacred ordinances are performed in these temples.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/where-are-the-keys-and-authority-of-the-priesthood.p20" pid="kVXzu_1J60moimfjU5Zs0g" hash="YlVEJw"&gt;Can you see the relationship between priesthood keys and blessings? As you engage in this work, I think you will find that the Lord is in its details. An experience demonstrates this. I recently learned of a mother who regularly escorted her children to the temple to perform proxy baptisms. On this particular day, as this family completed their baptisms and were leaving the temple, a man entered the baptistry area with a large batch of his own family names. Realizing there was no one remaining in the baptistry to assist with these family names, a temple worker caught the departing family and asked the children if they would consider reentering and changing once again to assist with these baptisms. They willingly agreed and went back in. As the children were baptized, their mother, listening, began to recognize the names and soon, to the amazement of all, realized the man’s batch of family names were deceased ancestors of her family as well. A sweet, tender mercy for them.&lt;/p&gt;

We note that when President Thomas S. Monson was sustained as an Apostle in 1963, there were 12 operating temples in the Church. Temples are getting closer and closer to you. However, for those of you who live where distance or circumstances do not allow regular temple attendance, you should always keep yourself worthy to attend. You can do important work outside of temples as you research and submit your family names.&lt;/p&gt;

Thousands of years later, the blessings of the dispensation of the gospel to Abraham were restored. This occurred when the prophet Elias appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery in the Kirtland Temple.&lt;/p&gt;

These blessings can be yours if you remain faithful and live worthy. In the pamphlet &lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;For the Strength of Youth,&lt;/span&gt; you are given some very practical instruction about how to “go forward with faith.” I summarize some of that counsel: “To help you become all that the Lord wants you to become, kneel each morning and night in prayer to your Father in Heaven. … Study the scriptures each day and apply what you read to your life. … Strive each day to be obedient. … In all circumstances, follow the teachings of the prophets. … Be humble and willing to listen to the Holy Ghost.”&lt;/p&gt;

He will increase your opportunities, expand your vision, and strengthen you. He will give you the help you need to meet your trials and challenges. You will gain a stronger testimony and find true joy as you come to know your Father in Heaven and His Son, Jesus Christ, and feel Their love for you.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The Lord has shown us that He will not leave us standing in the bitter cold without keys or authority to lead us safely home to Him.&lt;/p&gt;

When this happens to me, I can’t help but smile inside, for as I am looking for the keys, I find myself reflecting on restored priesthood keys and on President Thomas S. Monson, whom we sustain “as prophet, seer, and revelator”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt; and as the only person on earth who possesses and is authorized to exercise all priesthood keys. Yes, the keys are safely in the possession of prophets, seers, and revelators. They are conferred, delegated, and assigned to others in accordance with the Lord’s will, under the direction of the President of the Church.&lt;/p&gt;

I’d like to share a true story with you, a story that can be both an example and a lesson. It can show you how to get closer to the Lord and access greater power to resist temptation.</p>

She, her mother, older brother, and younger sister moved to a new city in another state to live with her aunt and uncle. Sometime after the family arrived, missionaries and members of a newly organized religion came to their town with the glorious news of the Restoration of the gospel. They told a remarkable story of an angel delivering an ancient record to a young man named Joseph Smith, a record he had translated by the power of God. Two of the visitors, Oliver Cowdery and John Whitmer, had actually seen the engraved metal pages of the ancient record with their own eyes, and Whitmer witnessed he had held the golden plates in his own hands. This record had been recently published, and Brother Whitmer brought the book with him. The name of the book, of course, was the Book of Mormon.</p>

Even though the Book of Mormon was thick with many pages, Mary yearned to read it.

I was impressed by our teacher’s lesson preparation and his very good question, which stirred in me over and over again.</p>

If you remember, I shared that Fernando and his brother had been baptized, but his parents and three younger brothers had not. And, despite receiving numerous invitations to meet with the missionaries over the years, each time the family declined.</p>

Unlike Fernando and unlike Bayley’s family, they found no comfort or peace. They could not understand how their own son, along with Bayley’s family, could bear their heavy burden.</p>

Following this realization, they invited the missionaries to teach their family the gospel. As a result, they received their own witness and testimony of the great plan of happiness, which brought them the sweet peace and calming comfort they were desperately seeking.</p>

				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/how-does-the-holy-ghost-help-you.p43" pid="p1IOM2IWaUGJyRnU4vk0wQ" hash="VjszAA">Let’s now summarize. We have identified three revealed truths that bring us to a knowledge of the Holy Ghost. These are that the Holy Ghost is the third member of the Godhead, the Holy Ghost is a personage of spirit, and the gift of the Holy Ghost comes by the laying on of hands. We also identified three answers to the question “How does the Holy Ghost help you?” The Holy Ghost warns, the Holy Ghost comforts, and the Holy Ghost testifies.</p>

We begin to do so by striving to keep the commandments, having individual and family prayer, reading the scriptures, and seeking loving and forgiving relationships with family and loved ones. We should keep our thoughts, actions, and language virtuous. We should worship our Heavenly Father in our homes, at church, and, whenever possible, in the holy temple. Stay close to the Spirit, and the Spirit will stay close to you.</p>
