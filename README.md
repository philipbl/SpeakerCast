# Speakercast

Speakercast creates a podcast for every General Conference speaker. This allows you to get to know a speaker better, hearing common themes and styles throughout their talks.

To run Speakercast,

```
python speakercast.py
```

This will download the necessary databases, save the rss feeds in a `feeds` folder, and generate covers in the `covers` folder. Speakercast supports Python 3.6+.
